{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference", "title": "Overview", "text": "Overview\n\nThis page gives you the overview of Capillary APIs.\n\nCapillary APIs are structured following the REST model. Our APIs use HTTPS protocol and support requests and responses in JSON format.\n\nHTTP methods\n\nThe HTTP methods used in Capillary APIs are as follows:\n\nKnow about API URL structure, host URL and headers\n\nAPI URL structure\n\nThe below image displays Capillary API structure with an example:\n\nThe resource ID is a combination of the Entity and the action you tell the API to perform. In this case, adding a customer is the entity and add is the action. For more information on entities, see Entities management .\n\nHost URLs\n\nA host is a server to which the API calls are made, usually the API cluster URL.\n\nThe host URLs are the same for both v1.1, v2, and v3 APIs. However, the v1 APIs mentioned in the documentation have different URLs for each entity. You can see those URLs under the respective section.\n\nRequest Headers\n\nHeader\n\nDescription\n\nValue\n\nAccept\n\nRequest format from the server side\n\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\n\nContent-Type\n\nRepresentation of data at the client side.\n\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\n\nUser-Agent\n\nA characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.\n\nFormat \\{product\\} {product-version} \\{comment\\} Example: User-Agent: Mozilla\\{version\\} ({system-information}) \\{platform\\} ({platform-details}) \\{extensions\\}\n\nCAP-API-ACCESS-TOKEN\n\nUnique access token generated with the Key and Secret combination.

This is applicable for the OAuth authentication only.\n\nTILL, STORE_CODE, STORE_NAME, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_1, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_2. The default value is TILL .\n\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE\n\nValue of the specified entity type.\n\nExample: If X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE is STORE_CODE , then X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE is the store code that you want to tag to POST data. By default, it considers the Till associated with the client key and secret.\n\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP-TYPE: \\{name} X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP: \\{value}\n\nSupported only for v2 APIs: Lets you submit requests on behalf of other TILLs (active TILLs) instead of the authenticating till. In db, the combination of attribution_lookup and lookup_code are mapped to TILL ids and org ids. When a new POST request is placed with the combination of a lookup name and lookup code, the data will be inserted in the db on behalf of the TILL that is mapped to the specified combination.\n\nNOTE: * It is recommended to use OAuth authentication.\n\nAccepted values are WECHAT and MOBILE_TRIGGER.\n\nResponse headers\n\nParameter\n\nDescription\n\nX-Cap-Requestid\n\nA unique ID generated for every promotional request. This ID is sent in the response headers and can be used to track the request and its response end-to-end. For batch transactions, this ID tracks the entire API call, including all promotions processed within the batch.\n\nx-cap-api-request-uri\n\nThis standardises endpoint identification by exposing the URI pattern in a response header instead of the raw URI, enabling cleaner metrics, better observability, and easier debugging. Example: Request → GET /v1/promotions/customer/12345 Response header → x-cap-api-request-uri: /v1/promotions/customer/customerId\n\nAPI version\n\nCapillary's APIs are divided into four versions:\n\nv1\n\nv1.1\n\nv2\n\nv3\n\nThese versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of:\n\nnew sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and\n\nupgraded versions of existing APIs.\n\nThe v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The V2 and V3 APIs are developed in JSON.\n\nAdditional features of v2 and v3 APIs\n\nThe list below highlights the additional features that v2 and v3 APIs support compared to v1 and v1.1 APIs:\n\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\n\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\n\nSupport multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID.

Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\n\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\n\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/data-entities", "title": "Entities Management", "text": "Entities Management\n\nAn entity refers to a specific object, like a customer, product, or transaction, that has its own unique details in a system or situation.\n\nThe different types of entities in Capillary platform are:\n\nCustomer : A customer is an individual who either buys goods/services or subscribes to the organization’s newsletters. An organization refers to a store, business firm, hospital, or restaurant. See v2 customer APIs and v1.1 customer APIs .\n\nTransactions : A transaction represents a purchase or return event. The parameters for transaction APIs are configuration dependent. See more details v2 transaction APIs and v1.1 transaction APIs .\n\nStore : The store entity holds information about an organization's stores and hierarchy. This entity provides APIs to manage stores. To know more, see Store APIs .\n\nProduct : The product entity holds all products of an org and product-related information such as size, color, type, and brand. Product APIs allow you to fetch details of a specific product, modify existing details, change a product's brand name, and create new attributes for a product. See Product APIs .\n\nBehavioral Events : Behavioral events help capture customer activities such as registration, forgot passwords, and cart abandonment. You can create custom events, fetch event data, configure event fields, and do more with Events APIs .\n\nCard : Cards are loyalty identifiers and enable orgs t o run card-based memberships. Cards are associated with a card series and each customer can have multiple cards. A card number or an card external ID is a unique identifier of a customer and is used in fetching customer details. See more about Cards APIs.\n\nUser Group : The new user group (v2) solves the use cases of both B2B loyalty and B2C loyalty unlike the previous version which was designed for B2C cases. This entity contains APIs to manage user groups. See more about User Group.\n\nLeads : A lead is a purchase an individual is interested in, especially for offline stores. Leads can be created for both loyalty and non-loyalty customers. This entity provides you the APIs to create, manage and fetch leads. See more about Leads APIs. .\n\nExtended Fields\n\nExtended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions).\n\nAn extended field is a predefined field with an id, name, entity type, label name, and data type.  Example: GUID, IMEI, making changes, and so on. Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item.\n\nExtended fields are created in the backend. You can just use whatever is required for you. to show or hide it on the UI.\n\nThe following are the topics discussed in this article.\n\nSupported Entity Types: customer, regular_transaction, return_transaction, not_interested_transaction, not_interested_return_transaction, regular_lineitem, return_lineitem, not_interested_lineitem, not_interested_return_lineitem.\n\nSupported Data types:  integer, string, double, date-time, standard_enum, custom_enum i. Standard Enum: Consists of predefined values that are common for any org. In the DB table, an extended field with the type standard_enum is mapped to one or more values. ii. Custom Enum: Consists of predefined values for each field and each value is mapped to a specific org. A value can be mapped to different orgs.\n\nSupported Data types:  integer, string, double, date-time, standard_enum, custom_enum\n\ni. Standard Enum: Consists of predefined values that are common for any org. In the DB table, an extended field with the type standard_enum is mapped to one or more values. ii. Custom Enum: Consists of predefined values for each field and each value is mapped to a specific org. A value can be mapped to different orgs.\n\nThe following example shows the values of an extended field are mapped to different orgs (scope_ids).\n\nFollowing are the properties of extended fields.\n\nThe combination of name and entity type for extended fields should be unique\n\nExtended fields are not case-sensitive\n\nOn a broader view, extended fields are mapped to vertical ids, and vertical ids are mapped to org ids as shown in the following diagram.\n\nA vertical is a group that defines the nature of the business. An org can have multiple verticals mapped to it.\n\nFor example, if an org ABC sells fitness items and apparel, and another org XYZ sells stationery and sports items, both orgs have one common vertical – sports.\n\nFollowing are the properties of verticals:\n\nEach vertical is mapped to the relevant set of extended fields\n\nThe vertical name should be unique across the table\n\nFollowing are the properties of extended fields and vertical ids mapping:\n\nEach extended field can only be mapped to one vertical id\n\nOne vertical id can be mapped to multiple extended fields\n\nAn extended field with vertical id ‘-1’ is available for all the orgs. These are global fields and can be used by any org\n\nFollowing are the properties of vertical ids and org ids mapping table\n\nOrg and verticals have a many-to-many mapping\n\nAn org cannot use an extended field that is not within the verticals associated with it.\n\nAny org can use extended fields with the vertical id ‘-1’ ( fields)\n\nA validation rule can contain a logical or regex expression that evaluates the extended field values. Validation rules verify whether a field value meets the defined standards before saving it to the Mongo DB.\n\nThat is, If a rule is applied on an extended field, a validation check is performed whenever the field value is received. Once the field value is validated successfully, it will be saved to the Mongo DB.\n\nExamples for logical rules: >, <, >=, <=, =\n\nWe first create rules (>, <) and then map each rule to the extended fields. Following are the properties of validation rules:\n\nMultiple rules can be applied to an extended field\n\nOne rule can be applied to different fields\n\nApart from the rules validation, scope validation is also performed which is defined in the DB tables\n\nExtended fields with custom enum values can be used only by orgs that are mapped to it\n\nAn org can use only extended fields that are mapped to it through vertical ids\n\nExtended fields with vertical id mapping as -1 can be used by any org\n\nData fields\n\nStandard Fields : These are fields created for a specific module to capture basic details. This could be fields at customer level, transaction level, line-item level, coupon level and so on. Standard fields are created by Capillary and are available by default for each module.\n\nExtended Fields : Extended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions). See more about Extended fields .\n\nCustom Fields : As the name suggests there are custom fields that orgs need to capture for a specific module. It could be of any datatype and value. Reporting is not possible on custom field values. See more about Custom fields.\n\nExtended Fields\n\nExtended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations.

Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item.\n\nWhen an extended field is added to collect additional information, it starts accumulating data within our system. However, this data isn’t immediately visible in the user interface for audience creation. If you want to build an audience using filters based on the information stored in these extended fields, you need to raise a request to the Customer Success Team to create these filters. Once implemented, you can use these filters to create audiences. For more information refer audience creation using filters .\n\nExtended fields are created at the backend.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/customer_entity", "title": "Customer entity", "text": "Customer entity\n\nThis page provides you with information on customer entity\n\nThe Customer entity is the focal point around which all our data revolves. This entity includes information about each customer, ranging from essential contact details to demographic and geographic data. In addition, It also includes information about their purchase history, behavioural activities, loyalty details, the user groups they are part of, reward and coupon details and other related information.\n\nWithin this framework, the source through which a customer is registered is called a customer data source. This source serves as the initial touchpoint, capturing the basic details that contribute to the making of a customer profile. Additionally, the channels available for communication with the customer are referred to as customer communication channels. These channels play a pivotal role in establishing meaningful connections and fostering effective communication with customers.\n\nRelated entities\n\nA customer entity can have information related to other entities and similarly the other entities can include customer entity information. For example, card entity, and transaction entity can include information related to customer entity and vice-versa.\n\nSupported objects and fields\n\nThe below image provides you with information about the supported objects and fields in the customer entity.\n\nUnderstanding data sources\n\nIn our system, a \"Source\" refers to the origin or system from which customer information is integrated. Each source represents a unique system, integration, or data feed.\n\nCustomers may be represented differently across various sources. For instance, a customer named \"Christopher\" in one source could appear as \"Christo\" in another. This discrepancy underscores the necessity for identity resolution to establish a unified and accurate view of the customer.\n\nData integration involves collecting information from different sources, including identifiers, subscription statuses, and email addresses. This process merges and creates a consolidated, reliable customer profile. When the system receives information from the same identifier already present but from a different source, it analyzes, merges , and adds it to the existing customer profile under a different source.\n\nOn Member Care, within the customer profile, you can view all the sources from which the customer registered.\n\nSupported data sources\n\nThe entity supports the following data sources:\n\nFacebook\n\nWeb_engage\n\nWeChat\n\nInstore\n\nE-Commerce\n\nWebsite\n\nLine\n\nMobile-APp\n\nLinkedin\n\nMpush-FCM\n\nMapp_SDK\n\nOAuth_External\n\nUnderstanding communication channels\n\nA \"Communication Channel\" represents the medium through which customers receive messages. Examples include SMS, push notifications, web engagement, and POS (Point of Sale) systems. Some sources may act as both a source and a communication channel. For instance, WeChat not only provides customer information but also serves as a communication channel.\nCommunication channels can vary, and information may be collected from diverse sources. For instance, a customer's communication channel, such as WeChat, may exclusively come from the WeChat system.\nOverlapping scenarios may arise where the source and communication channel are the same, while in other cases, they can be different. The system is designed to handle these variations effectively.\n\nSupported communication channels\n\nThe entity supports the following communication channels:\n\nWeChat\n\nMobile\n\niOS\n\nLine\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nAndroid\n\nPostmail\n\nManaging customer lifecycle with customer status\n\nA customer status defines the relationship between a brand and a customer. For example, a customer who interacts often with the brand can be defined as an active customer. Further, these statuses can be used to run the loyalty program and assign coupons, reward points etc accordingly. For example, more offers can be offered to a customer to make an inactive customer to active customer..\n\nActivating customer status\n\nTo activate customer status for your organisation, navigate to Organisation settings> Miscellaneous> Customer Status configuration and select the Enable customer status check box.\n\nOn enabling the customer status, the existing fraud status will be replaced by the customer status function.\n\nTypes of customer statuses\n\nThe various customer statuses available in the Capillary platform that you can configure are:\n\nActive\n\nSuspended\n\nDeleted\n\nFraud suspected\n\nFraud confirmed\n\nInternal\n\nPending deletion\n\nCreating a custom label\n\nYou can click the Create new label option in the customer label and enter a new label name to assign a custom name for the status. You can add multiple labels if required. The first status label that you create is set as the default status value.\n\nActive customer status\n\nThe active status can be used to indicate that the customer is active.\n\nNOTES:\n\nThere are no restrictions for customers with Active status.\n\nAll customers are marked Active by default.\n\nSuspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed, and Internal customer status\n\nYou can restrict the following operations for the users with Suspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed or Internal status.\n\nRestriction\n\nDescription\n\nBlock coupons redemption\n\nRestrict from redeeming coupons.\n\nBlock issual of loyalty promotions\n\nRestrict from receiving points.\n\nBlock identifier change and account merge\n\nRestrict from account merging and identifier change requests.\n\nBlock issual of badges\n\nThis is a future development feature.\n\nBlock issual of coupons\n\nRestrict from providing coupons.\n\nBlock enrollment into loyalty promotions\n\nThis is a future development feature.\n\nBlock points allocation\n\nRestrict from providing points.\n\nWhen this restriction is added on any label, then the points allocation from any points-related action (like transaction point allocation, allocation points, target point allocation, issue to the referrer, issue to referee, goodwill points, import profile) will be blocked for the customer.\n\nBlock points redemption\n\nRestrict from redeeming points.\n\nBlock tier upgrade\n\nRestrict from tier upgrade.\n\nBlock transaction\n\nRestrict future transactions.\n\nMark transaction outlier\n\nMark the transactions made by the selected label(s) as outliers.\n\nTo restrict access, select the individual status labels or all the created status labels from the desired restriction drop-down. Click Select , and then click Update .\n\nDeleted customer status\n\nThe deleted status allows you to block every action for customers with this status. To configure restriction, from the Block everything drop-down, select the individual custom labels or select all labels created for Deleted. Click Select and then click Update .\n\nPending deletion customer status\n\nThis status is used to indicate the status of customers for whom a deletion request is raised. For Pending Deletion , whenever a PII deletion request is triggered, a label Deletion_pending is automatically created and assigned to the customer, regardless of any other label that may have been created and set as default.\n\nManaging subscription\n\nA subscription refers to the voluntary action taken by customers to either opt in or opt out of receiving promotional or transactional communications from specific sources within the organization.\n\nYou can configure the promotional and transactional subscription settings for a customer according to their preferences. For more information, refer to the Subscription management documentation.\n\nYou can also view and set the subscription statuses on the customer's profile on Member Care .\n\nManaging loyalty status\n\nA customer can be of two types: a loyalty customer and a non-loyalty customer. A loyalty customer is a registered member of your organization's loyalty program, while non-loyalty customers are those who have not enrolled in your loyalty program but have subscribed using their mobile number or email ID with the organization. Transactions for these customers are tagged to their respective identifiers (mobile number/email ID).\n\nYou can define the loyalty type of a customer during customer registration or while adding a transaction .\n\nThe loyalty status of a customer is displayed on the Customer status in the customer's Member Care profile.\n\nManaging test and control status\n\nThe customer list is split into a test and control group. Customers in the test audience group receive campaign communications, while those in the control audience group do not. The test and control statuses are displayed based on the group to which they belong. These statuses are maintained by the brands or auto-assigned and can be changed either through Member Care or Connect+ .\n\nManaging fraud status\n\nYou can configure the fraud management and the statuses as per your requirements. For more information on fraud management, refer to the Fraud management documentation .\n\nNote\n\nIf customer status is enabled, the fraud status will be superseded by the customer status.\n\nGetting started\n\nSetup customer fields\n\nStandard fields, Extended fields and Custom fields are the fields that are applicable for Customer entity. For more information on these, refer to the documentation on fields .\n\nSetup customer configs\n\nTo configure customer registration, follow these steps.\n\nOn the InTouch home page, navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Miscellaneous > Registration Configuration .\n\nConfigure the required fields based on the description provided in the following table.\n\nOPTION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nCONF_REGISTRATION_PRIMARY_KEY\n\nChoose the primary identifier of the customer.

First with base country code, followed by supported country codes.\n\nExternal ID configuration\n\nYou can use the below configurations to enable the generation of a customised external ID for the customers. Once this configuration is enabled, the external ID in the customer add API payload will be replaced with the generated external ID.\n\nAttention\n\nThere is no UI to enable this configuration. You need to raise a JIRA ticket ( sample ticket ) to the sustenance team to enable these configurations. Turn around time is five days.\n\nConfiguration & Description\n\nValue\n\nCONF_CARD_NUMBER_GENERATION_ENABLED (Mandatory)\nEnables external ID number generation.\n\n0 - Disable\n1 - Enable\n\nSOURCE_ACCOUNTS_EXTERNALID_ENABLED (Mandatory)\nEnables external ID generation only for the defined source account in the Customer ADD API.\n\n[\"INSTORE:\"] -  Instore\n\n[\"web_engage:1234\"][\"web_engage:1234\"] -\nWebengage where 1234 is the account id\n\n[\"INSTORE:\", \"web_engage:1234\"][\"INSTORE:\", \"web_engage:1234\"]  -  Both Instore and webengage where 1234 is account id.\n\nCONF_CARD_CHECKSUM_DIGIT_ALGO (Mandatory) Defines the algorithm to generate the checksum. The checksum is added as the last digit of the external ID.\n\nLUHN_ALGO (MOD10), MOD7_ALGO, AUTO_INC, RANDOM, RANDOM_LUHN, RANDOM_MOD7\n\nCONF_CARD_NUMBER_LENGTH (Mandatory) Defines the external ID length. This is the total length of the external id including prefix, suffix, and checksum.\n\nExample: If card number length = 12, Prefix = 1234, Suffix = 3401, Offset = 3000, and algorithm = AUTO_INC, then card number can be 123430003401. Note: Suffix is not applicable for MOD7 and LUHN_ALGO (MOD10) algorithms.\n\nIntegers ranging from 1-50.\n\nCONF_CARD_NUMBER_OFFSET (Optional) Defines the offset value for the external ID.

Turn around time is five days.\n\nCONF_RESTRICT_ORPHAN_V2_PROFILE - This configuration prevents the ingestion of a WebEngage profile into the Capillary platform for a specific customer if they do not already have an existing Instore profile.\n\nSetup customer status\n\nFor configuring customer status, refer to the Activating customer status section .\n\nDual eligibility\n\nThe Dual Eligibility feature allows you to register multiple users with the same secondary identifiers. When the Dual Eligibility feature is enabled, only one identifier is considered the primary identifier and the rest of the identifiers are considered for communication. The primary identifier for both of these profiles must be unique.\n\nExample: Consider a brand user who is registered on the platform using Email [email protected] , Mobile 123-456-7890 (primary identifier), and External ID ABC123. With the Dual Eligibility feature enabled, another user can be registered again using Email [email protected] and External ID ABC124.\n\nNotes:\n\nFor the users registered with Dual Eligibility, the information about the user can be retrieved only using the primary identifier.\n\nUse Case\n\nUser John :\n\nWorks for Employer A and registers on the employer’s healthcare App with: Email : [email protected] Mobile : 123-456-7890\n\nEmail : [email protected]\n\nMobile : 123-456-7890\n\nJohn’s Spouse, Jane :\n\nWorks for Employer B and registers her family on the healthcare App. During registration: She adds John as a dependent using the same email ( [email protected] ) but a different mobile number 456-123-123) .\n\nShe adds John as a dependent using the same email ( [email protected] ) but a different mobile number 456-123-123) .\n\nOutcome :\n\nTwo unique profiles are created for John: One is associated with Employer A (where John is the primary user).

Then, assign a ticket to the Platform team requesting to enable Org Units for the org. Once the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have a user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level.\n\nOnce the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have a user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level.\n\nThis article covers the following topics.\n\nDefine Organization structure : This includes zones, concepts, store-servers, stores, and store-tills.\n\nOrganization Users : This includes registering admin users for your organization, creating user roles, and assigning user roles to define the scope of accessibility for each user to your organization's data.\n\nBefore starting with the organization setup, you need to understand the basic terminologies used in the hierarchy.\n\nConcept : These are a logical grouping of stores for a single brand org. For example, groceries, electronics, apparel, and home appliances; and logical separation of brands in case of multi-brand org. For example, if an org ABC is into different verticals (say a supermarket, retail, and electronics as brands), each brand can have its own account through concept hierarchy.\n\nThe following are the features of the Org Unit (OU).\n\nUsers and access management at the OU level.\n\nCampaign and loyalty program creation at OU level.\n\nReports  (Insights+) at OU level.\n\nView customer information at the OU level.\n\nNote\n\nCustomer registration remains the same across org. For example, a customer registered in an org unit will be registered automatically in all other org units. Hence, the registration date remains the same across org units.\n\nZones : These are a geographical grouping of stores. For example, north, south, east, and south-east.\n\nStore Server: It is a local server for a store. The data captured by InStore is first saved in the store-server and from there the data will sync to the main server. Tills are associated to Store Server. However, Store Server is not required for Tills with an internet connection.\n\nStores: These are usually the branches or outlets of an organization or you can say a physical store.\n\nTill/Store Till:  A Till is a POS machine where the billings happen. A store can have one or more Tills. All the tills should be connected to the store-server through LAN and hence no internet is required at the till level to sync data to the store-server. However, store-server communicates with the main server over the internet.\n\nThe hierarchy of an organization is as follows -\n\nZones > Stores (Stores can be grouped independently by zones and concepts) > Store Servers > Store Tills.\n\nStores are geographically grouped using zones and can also be logically grouped using the concept. Hence, a store can be for a zone or for a combination of a zone and a concept.\n\nAn org hierarchy can have up to 5 levels including Tills. In the hierarchy, Till is the lowest level and you can create other levels depending on the org structure.\n\nLogin to InTouch of your cluster and follow these steps.\n\nCreate Concept\n\nCreate Zone\n\nCreate Store\n\nAdd Store Server\n\nAdd Till\n\nCreate concept\n\nYou can use concepts for logical grouping for single-brand orgs, and as org units for multi-brand orgs. The creation process remains the same for both.\n\nIf you need to have concepts as org units, after creating concepts, log a ticket to enable org units for your org and assign it to the Platforms team.\n\nNote\n\nOnce the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level.\n\nTo create a concept, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Concepts .\n\nClick Add New Concept .\n\nFill in the details based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit.\n\nCode : A unique code for the zone.\n\nName : Name of the zone.\n\nDescription : Short description of the zone.\n\nParent Concept : Choose the parent concept for the concept if any. For example, if you are creating a concept Apparel, you can have sub-concepts as men apparel, kids’ apparel women apparel and so on. * Default Language : The default language used for the concept.\n\nDefault Currency : The default currency used across the concept.\n\nDefault Time Zone : The default time zone of the concept.\n\nSimilarly, you can create any number of concepts  required for the org.\n\nCreate zone\n\nThe following procedure guides you in creating zone hierarchy\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Zones .\n\nClick Add New Zone .\n\nFill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click Create Zone .\n\nCode : Enter a unique zone code in apha-numeric.\n\nName : Enter a name for the zone. For example, North\n\nDescription : Enter a short description of the zone.\n\nParent Zone :  Tag a parent zone for child zones. For example, if you want to create the India-east zone under the India zone. Then the parent zone for India-east will be India.\n\nDefault Language : Default language that you want to associate with the zone (regional language).\n\nDefault Country : Country of the zone.\n\nDefault Time Zone : Preferred time zone.\n\nSimilarly, create the entire zone hierarchy for your organization.\n\nCreate Store\n\nStores are the second level from the bottom in the hierarchy. A store can be associated with a zone and concept.\n\nTo create a store, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Stores .\n\nClick Add New Store .\n\nFill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit .\n\nStore Code : The store code to be identified in Capillary Cloud. It is recommended to use the following format for store code. ....\n\nStore Name : Name of the store you want to register. The store name must be unique within the cluster. You cannot use the same name across organisations in the same cluster.\n\nNote\n\nNote:\n\nThe UI does not support the addition of special characters in the store name. Special characters in the store name can only be added when adding stores using the data import option.\n\nStore Description : Short description of your store.\n\nParent Store : The parent store for the store. You can create child stores for a parent store. This option displays the list of all the stores you have registered for your organization.\n\nParent Concept : The logical group (Concept) of the store.\n\nStore Default Language : The language used at the store.\n\nStore Default Currency : The base currency at the store location (currency of the country where the store is located).\n\nStore Default Time Zone : The geographical location of the store. All the zones created for your organization is displayed in the drop-down.\n\nAccess Group : Access group to which the store has access. All the tills under the store inherit the access group of the store and will have access to the APIs accordingly.  You can also assign a default access group for all the stores under your organisation. For information on access groups, see Access group .\n\nStore Code Representation for the Org : The external id of your brand. External ids.This should be unique and should not be a used external code.\n\nSet the Admin Type : Set this as General for a live store. If you would like to test the store before making it live, choose Admin .\n\nSimilarly, you can create all the required stores for your org.\n\nAdd Store Server\n\nIn stores where PoS machines do not have access to the internet, you will have a store server that has an internet connection. All POS machines (or TILLs) are connected to the store server through LAN.\n\nA store will usually have one store server.\n\nTo add a store server, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Store Servers .\n\nClick Add New Store Server .\n\nEnter the store server details based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit .\n\nStore : The store to which store-server needs to be configured.\n\nStore Server Username : Enter the username of the store-server provided by Capillary for that particular store.\n\nStore Server Password : Enter the password of the store server provided by the Capillary for that specific store.\n\nConfirm Password : Reenter the password of the store server.\n\nSimilarly, you can add all the necessary store servers required for your brand.\n\nAdd Till\n\nTILL is a PoS machine and is the last entry in the org hierarchy. Each TILL needs to be mapped to a store. You also need to map to a store server, for models where TILLs have no internet access.\n\nTo add a new TILL, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Store Tills .\n\nNavigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Store Tills .\n\nClick Add New Till .\n\nClick Add New Till .\n\nEnter TILL details based on the description provided in the following. Click Submit to save your changes and create the Till.\n\nEnter TILL details based on the description provided in the following. Click Submit to save your changes and create the Till.\n\nStore : The store to which store-till needs to be assigned.\n\nStore Server : Store Server for the till. This acts as a local server for the POS machine (Store Till).\n\nTill Name : Username of the In-Store application for that till. The name must start with a lowercase letter ( a – z ). The rest can include lowercase letters, digits, dot ( . ), underscore ( _ ), or hyphen ( - ). Uppercase letters and other special characters are not allowed. The name must be at least 3 characters long. The Till name specified will also be copied to Till code in the backend.\n\nTill Description : Description for the till, if any.\n\nTill Password : The password of the In-Store application for that till.\n\nConfirm Password : Reenter the password of the In-Store.\n\nSimilarly, you can add all the TILLs required for the org.\n\nUpdated 3 months ago"}

However, sometimes, in those transactions, we might get:\n\nLine item that is not present in the master list\n\nPayment method that is not registered in the system\n\nStores whose details are not yet added in the capillary system\n\nMissing transaction extended field\n\nMissing customer extended field\n\nWhenever these situations occur, those transactions will be stopped from processing (rejected), and will be moved to a centralised sanity queue instead based on below.\n\nAfter this enhancement, the handling will be as below:\n\nIf they are of 1st, 2nd, 3rd type, they will be moved to the sanity queue.\n\nIf they are of 4rth, 5th type: If they are of enum (basically a bunch of options), they will be moved to the sanity queue. For all the other types, they will be marked as failed permanently.\n\nIf they are of enum (basically a bunch of options), they will be moved to the sanity queue.\n\nFor all the other types, they will be marked as failed permanently.\n\nRemember, all these transactions will be marked either as “pending” or “failed” as per above flow. All these configurations need to be enabled by the brands, otherwise the system will default to current behavior.\n\nOnce these transitions are moved to the sanity queue, an event notification will be sent to the respective brands notifying them that we have received these types of transactions. Brands can fetch these transactions from APIs too to check about them as per their policies (daily, weekly, etc..)\n\nIn the event notification that will be sent to brands, it contains following information:\n\nEvent name\n\nEvent datetime\n\nBill number\n\nCustomer identifier\n\nRejection type, .i.e., can be reprocessed or not\n\nReason of the rejection\n\nSource details of the bill\n\nBrands can get these transactions from API  based on:\n\nRejection type\n\nAll pending transactions for a customer\n\nThen brands need to provide the new data points (new line items, new payment methods, new store, new extended field values) that can be considered for transactions to Capillary. Once they are updated in the Capillary system, all these transactions in the sanity queue will be re-processed once again by our capillary system.\n\nDuring the reprocessing, the process will happen based on the processed date not the original bill date. The APIs involved in this entire sanity queue are following:\n\ngetRejectedTransactions: Fetches all the rejected transactions for the org, based on the input query params.\n\nretriggerTransactionAdd: Checks and updates the status of rejected Transaction.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/setup-test-behavioral-events", "title": "Setup Behavioral events", "text": "Setup Behavioral events\n\nBehavioral Events Overview\n\nEvents are activities of a customer either on an online store or at a physical store. Behavioural Event is a platform that lets you create standard and custom events to capture customer activities across channels. After you create an event, whenever it is triggered, the payload containing the defined attribute information is sent to the webhook. The Behavioral Event framework listens to this event, validates it, and sends it to the corresponding destination such as loyalty, journey, etc.\n\nObjective\n\nThe Behavioral Events data collected across sources can be used to develop personalized content, segment customers, or even incentivize customers.\n\nThis product solves different use cases for different verticals.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn an offline retail or brick-and-mortar store, you can send coupons to customers for different events such as scanning a QR code of a particular product category, or showing interest in a particular item.  This increases conversion without customers visiting the store again.\n\nIn an offline retail or brick-and-mortar store, you can send coupons to customers for different events such as scanning a QR code of a particular product category, or showing interest in a particular item.

By default, Insights+ consumes any event that you create on Behavioral Events. However, you need to manually set if you want to consume by Loyalty+.\n\nLoyalty+ : This includes both loyalty and DVS (Dynamic Voucher System).\n\nConsumed by Loyalty Manager to send messages to customers or incentivize them based on events data. For example, you could send a message when a product a customer is looking for is of limited stock.\n\nConsumed by Bounceback Campaign to run engagement programs based on the events data. For example, you could send discount coupons on product abandonment or product add-to-cart events.\n\nInsights+ (upcoming feature) to analyze events data. For example, most searched products frequently searched products during a festival season.\n\nTypes of Behavioral Events\n\nThe following are two types of Behavioral Events available.\n\nStandard Events (Library of predefined events) : These are predefined events with all the required attributes and values. The following is the list of standard events. Administrators can enable events that are required for an organization.\nProduct Removed From Cart, Customer Logged Out, App Installed, Product Added To Cart, Customer Registered, Category Viewed, Product Viewed, Customer Logged In, Coupon Applied, Product Searched, Coupon Denied, and App Uninstalled.\n\nStandard Events (Library of predefined events) : These are predefined events with all the required attributes and values. The following is the list of standard events. Administrators can enable events that are required for an organization.\nProduct Removed From Cart, Customer Logged Out, App Installed, Product Added To Cart, Customer Registered, Category Viewed, Product Viewed, Customer Logged In, Coupon Applied, Product Searched, Coupon Denied, and App Uninstalled.\n\nCustom Events : If you want to capture a specific customer activity other than in Standard Events, you can create custom events with the event names, attributes, and values.\n\nCustom Events : If you want to capture a specific customer activity other than in Standard Events, you can create custom events with the event names, attributes, and values.\n\nThe following table provides an understanding of choosing between standard and custom events.\n\nNew terminologies\n\nWebhook\n\nEnables syncing and relaying data between third-party applications and the Capillary Server facilitating automated calls and real-time updates.\n\nWebEngage\n\nMulti-channel user engagement platform that lets you automate communications.\n\nTransformer\n\nUsed to convert the payload sent by the third-party app to a payload understood by Capillary. In simple terms, it is a field mapping.\n\nWebhook Adapter\n\nUsed to track real-time events data that consists of payload understandable by the Capillary system.\n\nIntegration\n\nAutomates pushing event data from a third-party app or website to the Capillary system. There are two types of integrations-\n\nWebEngage to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform with WebEngage.\n\nCustom integration to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform to any other third-party apps.\n\nSource in which a customer is registered. Example: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, InStore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, Ecommerce, Website, and Line.\n\nEvent and Attribute\n\nEvent is customer activity such as logging out, adding items to cart, and so on. Whereas, attributes are entries of an event that needs to be captured by our system. For example, for the event product review, you could have attributes like title and review message body.\n\nStandard Event\n\nA predefined event with a defined set of attributes.\n\nCustom Event\n\nA user-defined event that lets you define your own attributes that you want to capture.\n\nStandard Attributes\n\nThe standard attribute in a behavioural event system is a default attribute that will be applicable for all the events. There are two standard attributes, eventDateTime and storeUnitID . These attributes need not be defined during the creation of an event and are applicable for all events by default.\n\nstoreUnitID - This attribute is used only for internal usage.\n\neventDateTime - This is a standard attribute that captures the event processing time. If a value is sent for the eventDateTime attribute, such as 2024-03-24 12:00:00, it serves as the timestamp for the event. However, if no value is sent or the attribute is missing in the payload, the time of event processing becomes the event timestamp.\n\nThe formats that are acceptable for the eventDateTime attribute are given below:\n\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX\n\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S\n\nyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\n\nyyyy-MM-dd\n\ndd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\n\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\n\nyyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss\n\nyyyy/MM/dd\n\ndd-MM-yyyy\n\nMM/dd/yyyy\n\nyyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss\n\ndd-MMM-yy\n\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss\n\nEEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy\n\nMMMM,dd,yyyy\n\nMMMM,dd\n\nyyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss\n\nNote\n\nThe Behavioural event system saves the value for the eventDateTime attribute in the system as is, without any timezone offset. If there is no value provided for the attribute, it processes the time according to the GMT timezone and saves the datetime value without the timezone offset.\n\nCustom Attributes\n\nThe custom attributes are user-defined attributes for each event. You can define attributes such as customer ID, product code, booking ID, product category, etc., and map the fields to capture the corresponding information. For example, you can create an attribute named CustomerMobileNumber and map it to Customer ID > Mobile number.\nThese attributes can be of any of the following data types:\n\nEnum\n\nGroup ID\n\nTill Code\n\nCoupon Code\n\nCustomer ID\n\nDate\n\nProduct SKU\n\nProduct Brand\n\nCurrency Code\n\nProduct Category\n\nString\n\nDouble\n\nEvent routing in Connected Organizations\n\nWhen a customer performs an action, two events are generated—one for the child organization and one for the parent. Both events are delivered to the parent organization’s webhook and have unique event IDs.\n\nTo enable centralised routing, the app sends all behavioural events to the parent webhook. The event payload includes a custom attribute called orgResolver , which contains the childOrgId .\n\nThe parent webhook uses this ID to route each event to the correct child organization. The child org then processes the event and applies the relevant logic—for example, awarding reward points.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe app sends all behavioural events to the parent organization’s webhook .\n\nThe event payload includes a custom attribute named orgResolver , which contains the child organization ID .\n\nThe parent webhook reads the childOrgId and routes the event to the appropriate child organization.\n\nThe child organization processes the event and applies any relevant logic (e.g., awarding reward points).\n\nExample: Multi-org health app\n\nA health app is used by employees across 400 companies. Instead of configuring 400 webhooks, the app:\n\nSends all events to a parent org webhook .\n\nUses Neo to map the customer to the correct organization.\n\nAdds the childOrgId to the event payload using the orgResolver attribute.\n\nThe parent webhook routes the event to the correct child organization.\n\nThe child organization processes the event and awards points accordingly.\n\nMapping\n\nAlso called attribute mapping that lets you map attributes of a behavioural event with the attributes of a third-party application.\n\nLimitations of Behavioral Events\n\nThe following are the limitations of Behavioral Events.\n\nNo support for standard entities such as SKU, and category in filters and KPIs for custom events.\n\nNo support for anonymous events, customer identifier is required.\n\nData is captured only from predefined integrations (such as WebEngage or Webhook), and not directly from sources (such as eCommerce websites, apps, and WeChat).\n\nThe platform registers customers from the registered user profiles data shared in the S3 bucket. If there is no WebEngage integration, customer registration needs to handle through API Integration.\n\nLimitations for Custom Events:\n\nA maximum of 10 active events are allowed in an org.\n\nA maximum of 20 attributes are allowed in an event.\n\nCustom attribute names can have only up to 50 characters.\n\nCustom attributes can have only enum, date, Boolean, integer, double, and string as data types.\n\nSteps to configure and publish an event\n\nCreate a Webhook integration for a WebEngage platform or any other third-party apps or platforms.\n\nCreate a new custom event or add a standard event.\n\nCreate attribute mapping.\n\nRun a sample test to validate whether the data is flowing correctly as desired.\n\nPublish the event.\n\nAdd Webhook Integration\n\nWebhook facilitates pushing real-time data from a third-party application or website to the Capillary database through a web callback or HTTP push API. A Webhook integration is a combination of a third-party app and Till code. For every Webhook integration you create, a unique URL is generated. The respective third-party apps need to make a POST call to the URL passing events data.\n\nThere are two types of integrations\n\nWebEngage integration to capture events data from the WebEngage platform.\n\nCustom integration to capture events data from other platforms or apps other than WebEngage.\n\nTo create a Webhook integration, follow these steps.\n\nClick Create Webhook .\n\nChoose WebEngage for WebEngage integration, else choose Custom for integration with other apps.\n\nIn Select till code , choose the Till code that you want to associate with the selected source. If an event has the attribute Till Code , then the Till Code that is captured for the event will be considered as a default one.\n\nClick Done\n\nYou need to use the integration URL to POST event data to Webhook through an API call.\n\nIf an event has the Till Code attribute, then the till code tagged in the Webhook or any other integration will not be considered.\n\nWebhook Configuration for Behavioural Events in Connected Organizations\n\nIn a Connected organization setup, you only need to configure the webhook at the parent organization level. The system automatically routes events from both the parent and all connected child organizations to this webhook.\n\nKey Behaviours\n\nSingle webhook setup - Configure the webhook only in the parent organization. No separate setup is required in the child organizations.\n\nSingle webhook setup - Configure the webhook only in the parent organization. No separate setup is required in the child organizations.\n\nEvent routing - All behavioural events, whether triggered in the parent or a child organization, are routed to the parent’s webhook.\n\nEvent routing - All behavioural events, whether triggered in the parent or a child organization, are routed to the parent’s webhook.\n\nProcessing order - Events are first processed in the child organization where they originated. The same event is then processed again at the parent level.\n\nProcessing order - Events are first processed in the child organization where they originated. The same event is then processed again at the parent level.\n\nChild-only webhooks - If a webhook is set up only in a child organization (outside the connected org setup), it processes events locally . These events are not sent to the parent webhook. If needed, you can enable listening to child events when setting up the parent webhook .\n\nChild-only webhooks - If a webhook is set up only in a child organization (outside the connected org setup), it processes events locally . These events are not sent to the parent webhook. If needed, you can enable listening to child events when setting up the parent webhook .\n\nAdd & map custom event\n\nCreate custom events if you want to capture specific details that are not available in standard events. You can use both standard and custom attributes to create custom events.\n\nThe following are the steps involved in publishing a custom event.\n\nTo create a custom event, follow these steps.\n\nLog on to InTouch\n\nGo to > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events .\n\nClick + Add Events.\n\nClick Create New Event and follow these steps\n\nIn Event Name , specify a name for the event without any space or special characters (except underscore). For example, DemoEvent. If there are spaces in the event name, the system automatically replaces the spaces with a double underscore. Hence, do not use double underscores while naming the event.\n\nIn Display Name , specify a name that you want to be displayed.\n\nIn Description , give a short description of the event.\n\nClick + Add Attribute to add event attributes and follow these steps.\n\nIn Name , specify an appropriate name for the attribute. Customer Identifier is a mandatory attribute for a custom event .\n\nIn Data Type , choose the type of the attribute.\n\nTYPE\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nCUSTOMER IDENTIFIER*\n(MANDATORY)\n\nThis is a mandatory attribute for an event and is used to identify an existing customer and also to register a new customer if required.\n\nYou need to configure identifier type, source, and associated source account.\n\nCustomer Identifier : Choose the identifier type from the available options - Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, userId, Martjack ID.\n\nSource : Choose the source from which you want to identify customers. Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources.\n\nSource Account : For sources with multiple accounts, such as WeChat or Facebook, choose the desired account to identify registered customers from that source account.\n\nAdd customer if not available : Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event.\n\nFor example, if you set customer identifier as email ID, and Source as InStore,\n\nwhen an email id that is already registered on InStore is identified, the data is tagged to the customer and saved in the Capillary system\n\nwhen an email id that is already registered on InStore is identified, the data is tagged to the customer and saved in the Capillary system\n\nwhen a new email id identified, the customer will be first registered if Add customer id not already present is enabled. The event details are tagged to the customer before saving the data.\n\nwhen a new email id identified, the customer will be first registered if Add customer id not already present is enabled. The event details are tagged to the customer before saving the data.\n\nEnum\n\nChoose this to capture the predefined values for the attribute. In POSSIBLE VALUES enter the supported values for the field separating each by a comma (do not leave space after a comma). For example, if Name is Hobby, you could have the values Music, Sports, Fishing, Archery, Gardening, Others.\n\nEnum is a data type consisting of a set of predefined values.\n\nTill Code\n\nChoose this to capture Till codes.\n\nCoupon Code\n\nChoose this to capture coupon codes and configure the Regex (regular expression) for coupon codes accordingly.\n\nA customer identifier attribute is required for any custom event.\n\nChoose this to capture customer identifiers, associated sources, and source accounts from which the event is triggered.\n\nNOTE *: Customer Identifier capturing is mandatory for custom events. You cannot save an event without this attribute.\n\nCUSTOMER IDENTIFIER *: Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, Martjack ID.\n\nSOURCE *: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources.\n\nSOURCE ACCOUNT *: For sources with multiple accounts such as WeChat and Facebook, choose the account that you want to associate with the attribute.\n\nADD CUSTOMER IF NOT AVAILABLE *: Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event.\n\nDate\n\nChoose this to capture date values. The following are the different date formats supported.\n\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd, dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss,\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd, dd-MM-yyyy, MM/dd/yyyy, yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss, dd-MMM-yy, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss, EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy, MMMM,dd,yyyy, MMMM,dd, and yyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss.\n\nProduct SKU\n\nChoose this to capture product SKUs or item codes.\n\nProduct Brand\n\nChoose this to capture product brands.\n\nProduct Category\n\nChoose this to capture product categories.\n\nString\n\nChoose this to capture free-flowing text that could contain alphabets, numbers, and spaces.\n\nDouble\n\nChoose this to capture a double data type.\n\nDouble is a 64-bit floating value with precision up to 15 decimal places_.\n\nEnable Required if the attribute is a required field for the event.\n\nEnable Is part of unique key , if you want the attribute to be a part of unique key. For information on uniqueness check, see Event uniqueness check . Any attribute that is made as part of the unique key, cannot be reverted to a non-unique field.\n\nEnable Is PSI data , if you want to classify the attribute as sensitive data. This is applicable for attributes that are of type Enum, String, and Double. Refer to the PSI data documentation for more information on classifying PSI data .\n\nSimilarly, click + Add Attribute to create more attributes for the event.\n\nClick Next to continue\n\nCheck EMF Consumer to show the event in Loyalty Manager, and Bounceback Campaign to reward points, coupons, or just send messages. By default, these events are consumed by Essential Insights.\n\nIn the Add destination page, select the Loyalty check box to send the event to Loyalty and process it. If it is not selected, the event is not sent to Loyalty and will not be considered for any points, rewards or any other loyalty program. By default, the Loyalty check box is not selected. You must manually select this option to send the event to Loyalty and Journey.\n\nClick Done to save the event.\n\nTest the event to see whether data is flowing to the system as expected. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process. For detailed instructions, see Test & Publish Event.\n\nThe Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually.\n\nClick Publish to publish the event.\n\nOnce the event is published, you cannot edit or delete either standard or custom attributes.\n\nAfter creating, testing, or publishing the custom event successfully you can map it with the source event. For details, refer to mapping custom events to source events.\n\nEnabling uniqueness check\n\nIn behavioural events, you can enable uniqueness checks and avoid issuing reward points for duplicate events. After the uniqueness check, duplicate events are not deleted nor does the Behavioral Event framework reject it. The EMF identifies duplicate events by checking their uniqueness. If there is a duplicate event, it is not processed. This ensures that points are not provided for duplicate events.\n\nUse case\n\nA behavioural event comes to Capillary from WebEngage and the timeout set for this request is 5 seconds at WebEngage. If Capillary fails to respond within 5 secs, WebEngage triggers the same request again. The uniqueness check enables to identify the duplicate events and avoids issuing reward points for duplicate events.\n\nTo enable uniqueness-check in the behavioural events, perform the following:\n\nEnable the uniqueness check configuration in the webhook. There is no UI to enable uniqueness check configuration in the webhook and this must be performed using the webhook API call. For new orgs, use the POST call and create a webhook with uniqueness check configuration or create a webhook using UI and use PUT API call to update the webhook. For more information, see Add webhook and Update webhook . For existing orgs, use PUT API call and update the webhook to enable the uniqueness check. 📘 Notes: Once enabled, you cannot disable the unique check configuration. Once uniqueness check is configured for the webhook, all the events in the org should have uniqueness check enabled.\n\nEnable the uniqueness check configuration in the webhook. There is no UI to enable uniqueness check configuration in the webhook and this must be performed using the webhook API call.\n\nFor new orgs, use the POST call and create a webhook with uniqueness check configuration or create a webhook using UI and use PUT API call to update the webhook.

Once uniqueness check is configured for the webhook, all the events in the org should have uniqueness check enabled.\n\nNotes:\n\nOnce enabled, you cannot disable the unique check configuration.\n\nOnce uniqueness check is configured for the webhook, all the events in the org should have uniqueness check enabled.\n\nIn the events page, use the toggle switch and add the desired attributes to unique key. You can do this using API or from the UI.  To add it from the UI, Enable the Is part of unique key switch. By default, the event name and customer identifier form the unique key. If an attribute is enabled, it is added as a part of the unique key with the event name and customer identifier. Unique key format : EventName_Customerid_Attribute1_Attribute2_.... Unique key :  md5 hash generated from combining the event name, customer identifier, and additional attributes in the EventName_Customerid_Attribute1_Attribute2 format. Example Consider the following scenario: Event name: Appointment Customer ID: 9123456789 Custom attribute for the event: refID In this scenario, the unique key format is Appointment_9123456789_refID, and the unique key is 779069e41a8afde74b2c526bce59e51a, which is the MD5 hash of Appointment_9123456789_refID. Make sure that the Required switch gets enabled. The unique key attributes are marked automatically when we enable the unique key switch. 📘 Once the attribute is enabled as part of the unique key, it cannot be disabled. By default, the event name and customer identifier are part of the unique key and the enabled attribute is added as a part of the unique key along with the event name and customer identifier.\n\nIn the events page, use the toggle switch and add the desired attributes to unique key. You can do this using API or from the UI.  To add it from the UI,\n\nEnable the Is part of unique key switch. By default, the event name and customer identifier form the unique key.

For example, the Capillary does not support an event name with a blank space. Suppose an event named Promotion Viewed is coming from WebEngage (source). You need to create a custom useevent - promotionViewed (custom event name) and map it to Promotion Viewed (source event name) using the event mapping process.\n\nBehavioral Events lets you map a custom event to a source event.  You can do it at any phase - after creating, testing, or publishing a custom event. You can map the source event name and attributes to a custom event name and attributes stored in Capillary's system.\n\nThe following are the different stages of event publishing when you can map a custom event to a source event.\n\nTo create a custom event, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events.\n\nIn the All Events tab, click + Add Event\n\nOn the Add Events page, click + Create New Event to create, test, and publish a custom event with attributes.\n\nTo map a custom event to a source event, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events.\n\nIn the All Events tab, search the existing or newly created custom event using the event name.\n\nClick + Add Mapping to map the custom event with the source event.\n\nOn the Add Mapping page, choose the source (For example, WebEngage or Custom). Once you save mapping details, you cannot change the source.\n\nIn Event Name , enter the event name of the source to map to the custom event name.\n\nEnter the source's event attribute to map the custom event and the source event attributes.\n\nClick Save .\n\nTo view and edit mapping, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events.\n\nIn the All Events tab, search your preferred custom event using the event name.\n\nClick on the mapped custom event and navigate to the Mappings tab to view the event mapping.\n\nNavigate to the Mappings tab, click the Edit icon.\n\nModify the mapping as You can modify the event name and event attributes - the event name and source attributes. The system does not allow to change the source.\n\nClick Save .\n\nAdd a Standard Event\n\nIn Source , select the source of the event. For now, only WebEngage is supported.\n\nIn Event Name, specify your preferred name for the event.\n\nIn Attributes, enter the name of each attribute as in the Source(WebEngage). The attributes on the left refer to the names as in the Capillary system.\n\nTest the event to see whether data is flowing to the system or not. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process.\n\nThe Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually.\n\nClick Publish to publish the event\n\nTest & Publish Event\n\nBy default, an event that is created will be in draft mode. Once the event is tested successfully and if the data is flowing as desired, you can publish the event to make it live.\n\nFor testing an event, you need to either pass the data in the supported format or in the code from where you want to implement or through API.\n\nTest event data using API\n\nBelow is the flow chart showing the steps involved in testing an event.\n\nHere are the steps to test an event using API.\n\nOn the Behavioral Events home page, in the All Events tab, search for the event that needs testing and click on the event name.\n\nOn the Behavioral Events home page, in the All Events tab, search for the event that needs testing and click on the event name.\n\nThe events attribute page opens.\n\nOn the event attributes page, go to the { } Code tab.

The status changes from Testing Pending to Publish.\n\nRefresh the Behavioral Events home page.  The status changes from Testing Pending to Publish.\n\nClick Publish to publish the event.\n\nClick Publish to publish the event.\n\nValidate event publishing in Member Care UI.\nFrom the customer home page, navigate to Events > Behavioral events to see the event published.\n\nValidate event publishing in Member Care UI.\nFrom the customer home page, navigate to Events > Behavioral events to see the event published.\n\nTimezone in behavioural events\n\nDescription: The system processes event times using GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). For instance, if an event is logged at 6 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), the system records the processing time as 12:30 PM GMT.\n\nDescription: The system considers the date mentioned by the user in the specified format. This can be used in scenarios where you want to capture a past-dated event.\n\nExample: For example, 2024-08-05T14:30:5.3 if the date format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S\n\nReporting\n\nBehavioural events created within the system are automatically onboarded into the Insights database once the data is pushed into the event. After an organization is onboarded to the automated Behavioral Events (BE) flow, the data corresponding to all the BEs will be available for reporting within 24 hours after completion of ETL sync. This would allow the users to create normal charts and migration charts powered on BE data.\n\nAudience Filters\n\nAs soon as a behavioural event is created and its data is available in Insights, an audience filter is available in Engage+ for segregating users and creating an audience group . For more information on audience filter-based reporting, refer to the Audience group filter in reports documentation.\n\nUpdated 26 days ago"}

For example, you can have card series for Digital and Physical Card. A card series contains information such as card series name, card type, card number configuration details, and expiry details. You can also extended fields for cards. You can either have auto-generated cards or manually generated cards.\n\nCard linked loyalty program: Card linked loyalty enables creating loyalty programs for each card series. This is applicable only for MLP enabled orgs. If a loyalty program is created based on card series, you cannot create another program based on zone or concept.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe following are the features of the Card Series module.\n\nCreate physical and digital card series for an org.\n\nCreate a card series with either auto-generated card numbers or manually generated card numbers.\n\nAuto-assign card numbers to customers during registration or first transaction after card-series creation.\n\nManually issue cards to customers through member care and integration platform (APIs).\n\nIssue one or more cards to customers from a card series.\n\nCreate a separate loyalty program for each card series .\n\nTerminologies in card module\n\nThere are a few terminologies that you need to know before starting card configuration.\n\nCard series : The card series represents different card types of an organization. For example. Value card, Premium card, Digital card, Physical card, and more. A card series stores information such as card series name, how to create card numbers for the card series, whether the card can expire and after how many days, and more.

Internal validations and out-of-box functionalities such as card-related KPIs use status codes and status labels. It also allows following different naming conventions to define card statuses. You can map multiple status labels to a status code. The system supports the following status codes. NOT_ISSUED :  This card is not issued to any customer ACTIVE :  The card is in an active status. SUSPENDED : The card is temporarily blocked but you can reactivate it. If the card number is used as an identifier, you cannot make any transaction or redeem points and vouchers using the card in this status. DELETED : You can modify nothing in a card with this status. You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption. EXPIRED : You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption. You cannot change the status as well. The following are examples of status labels. Card Assigned status label mapped to ACTIVE status code Card Blocked status label mapped to SUSPENDED status code. New Card status label mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code. Card Generated Card Printed and Card Distributed to Store’ multiple status labels mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code. Card Permanently Deleted’ status label mapped to DELETED status code.

The following are the three possible scenarios that can happen during registration or post-registration. For details, see issue card to a customer A digital or virtual card is issued to the customer. A physical card generated in Capillary is issued to the customer. A physical card not generated in Capillary is issued to the customer.\n\nCard issue : Card issue means linking cards to customers. The following are the three possible scenarios that can happen during registration or post-registration. For details, see issue card to a customer\n\nA digital or virtual card is issued to the customer.\n\nA physical card generated in Capillary is issued to the customer.\n\nA physical card not generated in Capillary is issued to the customer.\n\nCard configurations (Org level)\n\nYou need to configure the following card-related settings before creating the card series.\n\nMap standard status with preferred status labels.\n\nCreate multiple status labels for each standard status.\n\nSet the maximum number of cards issued to a customer.\n\nTo configure the card at the org level, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Organization Settings > Miscellaneous > Card Configurations .\n\nClick Modify global settings\n\nIn the Maximum no. of active cards per customer , enter the value to set the maximum number of cards (total number of card series) for a customer.\n\nIn Status Mapping , tag standard statuses to your preferred statuses (custom status labels). There are five different standard statuses - Not issued, Active, Inactive, Deleted, and Expired.\n\nTo create and map a status label, follow these steps.\n\na. Navigate to a status for which you want to add a custom status label. b. Click Create a new tag\n\nc. Enter a name for the status label.\n\nOnce the tag(status label) is created and saved you cannot edit or delete the tag.\n\nd. Click on the newly created tag to make it the default tag. If only one tag(status label) is created for a status code, the system considers this tag as the default status tag.\n\nClick Update .\n\nAfter successfully configuring the card at the org level, create a card series , generate card numbers , and issue cards to customers .\n\nCounting Only Active Cards for Customer Limits\n\nTo count only cards labeled as ACTIVE towards a customer's card limit, you can enable the configuration CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARD. Once enabled, only cards marked as ACTIVE will count towards the limit, while cards with statuses such as SUSPENDED or ISSUED will be ignored.\n\nBy default this configuration is disabled. To enable the Configuration , raise a JIRA request to the Product Support team requesting activation of CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARDS.\n\nNote\n\nOrg Level: The system will count only cards labeled as ACTIVE when enforcing the maximum card limit for a customer.\n\nCard Series Level: Similarly, only ACTIVE cards will be counted when determining the limit within a card series.\n\nWhen merging two customer profiles, the system will count only ACTIVE cards from both profiles.\n\nWhen Configuration Disabled:\n\nThe system counted ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, and ISSUED cards. If the customer had 3 ACTIVE, 1 SUSPENDED, and 1 ISSUED card, the system considered the total as 5, preventing additional card issuance.\n\nWhen configuration Enabled\n\nOnly ACTIVE cards are counted. The customer now has 3 ACTIVE cards, so they can receive 2 more ACTIVE cards.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nBefore configuring the card series, you need to set an org-related card configuration .\n\nCreate card series\n\nTo create a card series, follow these steps.\n\nNavigate to Organization Settings > Miscellaneous > Card Configurations\n\nSelect the Cards tab.\n\nClick Create card series .\n\nIn Name , enter the name of the card series.\n\nIn Series code , enter a unique series code.

Once the card series is created, you cannot modify the series code.\n\nIn Series type, choose the type of card series -\n\nDigital : A digital card is a modern version of the loyalty card. Customers can manage these loyalty cards through InTouch or mobile applications. You can generate and download card numbers for digital cards.\n\nPhysical : A physical card is a traditional version of a loyalty card. You have to carry these cards to the store to redeem or issue points during or post-transaction.\n\nConfigure the selected card series. If the Physical card is selected follow steps 7(a) and 7(b) else skip these steps.\n\nSelect the Physical card type.\n\nIn Enable card number generation , enable or disable the dynamic card number generation.\n\nEnable the option to dynamically generate card numbers. Usually, auto-generated card numbers are not suitable for physical cards. However, if you wish to have it for the org, you can enable it. For details on automated card generation, refer to step 8 .\n\nDisable the option to manually generate card numbers.\n\nIn Card generation , choose the options - Customer registered with this card series, Customer registered from specific Org Unit , or Any registered customer to generate the card numbers dynamically. The card generation option does not appear for the physical card series type when the Enable card number generation is disabled.\n\nCustomer registered from this card series : Select this option to generate card numbers when this card series code is passed during customer registration. By default Customer registered with this card, the series is selected for card series creation.\n\nCustomer registered from this card series : Select this option to generate card numbers when this card series code is passed during customer registration. By default Customer registered with this card, the series is selected for card series creation.\n\nCustomer registered from a specific Org Unit : Select this option to generate a card number using this card series where the customer registration request comes from a till code that is mapped to the selected org unit(concept). For the first time, cards will be generated when the customer transaction or update request comes from the selected org unit. i. Select the preferred org unit name using the drop-down list.\n\nCustomer registered from a specific Org Unit : Select this option to generate a card number using this card series where the customer registration request comes from a till code that is mapped to the selected org unit(concept).

The loyalty benefits such as points balance, earning rules, redemption rules, and tiers - are associated with a loyalty card (and not a country).\n\nMulti-Currency and Multi-Country Programs\n\nTo configure and create loyalty programs for multi-brand orgs, follow these steps -\n\nLog on to InTouch and go to the Loyalty tab. You will see existing programs and an option to create a new program.\n\nClick +Loyalty Program . MLP workflow can be broadly categorized into the following three phases.\n\nStep 1: MLP Configuration\n\nPlease note that there should be no overlap between any two programs.\n\nYou can define the boundaries of a loyalty program either by a zone or concept hierarchy.  If a loyalty program is defined on a concept basis, then all events originating from all tills of that concept will pass through its configured program.\n\nDefault Program : A default program is created when we create an org in our system. All concepts and zones are mapped to the default program irrespective a separate program is running for that concept/zone.\n\nStep 2: Events\n\nFor any event such as transaction and customer update, first, the relevant programs will be identified and then the configured rules and actions will be executed for that particular program.\n\nThe default program will always be executed. If the event also matches with any other non-default program, that will also be executed\n\nStep 3: Get Details (API Call)\n\nWhenever any information such as Current points, tier, and a bulk call is required, either the calling module will pass the corresponding program or the system will identify the corresponding program from the configuration and pass the relevant value to the caller.\n\nUse Cases\n\nPoints Allocation Strategy : Each program has its own points allocation strategies. A point allocation strategy can be created and used within a program. The allocation strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even within the Default Program. To know how to create Points Allocation Strategies, click here.\n\nPoints Expiry strategy : Each program has its own points expiry strategy. A point expiry strategy can be created and used within a program. The expiry strategy of one point cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. To know how to create Point Expiry Strategy, click here.\n\nPoints Redemption Strategy : Each program has its own points redemption strategy and points to currency conversion ratio. The redemption strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. Points redemption strategies can be created and used within a program. To know how to create point redemption strategies, click here.\n\nWhile making redemption, the caller has to specify from which program and how much point needs to be redeemed. Whenever a redemption call is made and the program id is not passed, the points will deduct from the program/till where the redemption call is made.\n\nManage Trackers : Trackers created within a program can be used and evaluated within the program. It will work the same as in the case of a single loyalty program. Tracker of one program can not be used or evaluated in any other program, not even in the default program. To know more click here.\n\nCustomer Registration : Customers once registered in any program by default will register across brands in the org but the enrollment will be done only for the program to which the till belongs.  Enrollment in other brands will not happen till the customer makes a transaction in that program.\n\nCustomer updates : Customer update events will pass through all the programs which as associated with the till from where the event is fired. So if the Org wants to allocate points to a brand loyalty program or a Default program, then they have to write rules on the brand loyalty program and Default program as well.\n\nManage Tiers : Tiers for each program can be created within the program and they work within the program only. Click here to know more.\n\nNew Transaction : Once a transaction is made, the corresponding programs will be identified, and accordingly “new transactions” rules will execute.\n\nTransaction Update : Any transaction update event will only pass through the corresponding program that is configured for the till from which the update event is initiated. In case the transaction creates and transaction update tills are different then rules will run for the program where the transaction has originated.\n\nTransaction Return : For the Transaction return event, the rules will be executed from the program where the purchase was made, not where the return is made. For eg, the Customer transacted at till 1(Program 1) but return the products at till 3 (Program 2), in this case, the return rules will be executed from Program 1, not for Program 2.\n\nRule and set configuration need to be configured at the program level depending on the requirement. The rules configured for lifetime purchases, current points, no. of transactions, etc are always in the context of the program. For example, lifetime purchases are the purchases made in that program.\n\nFor example, let's assume a customer has made 6 transactions across the organization in different tills/stores. If one writes a rule within program 1 on currentcustomer.lifetimepurchase, it will be evaluated on 1200, and on program 2 it will be evaluated on 900. Moreover, each program will have over customer KPIs such as Lifetime purchase, current points, lifetime points, trackers Visit count, and a number of transactions.\n\nOne will be able to see program-wise (including Default Program) details of a customer with program-level KPIs in Member care and Binary. See the figure below. For eg, if a concept/till is not mapped in the Default program then the corresponding transaction/point will not be available in customer KPIs in Default Program.\n\nLimitations\n\nCurrently, programs can run either at concept or zone but not both\n\nOne concept/zone can only have one loyalty program (excluding the default program)\n\nPoints can only be redeemed from one program at a time.\n\nMultiple Loyalty programs cannot run at the store level i.e. different programs at each store of the brand\n\nProduct category/brand based loyalty program configurations are not available\n\nMultiple currencies are not supported across loyalty programs.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An organisation can designate different roles to these members and incentivise them according to the organisation’s preference. User group loyalty allows an organisation to incentivise not only its customers but also other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which help an organisation to establish brand loyalty.\n\nIn user group loyalty, an individual’s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.\n\nFor example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction. This way of incentivising the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact with an organisation.\n\nKey concepts\n\nThe following are some of the key concepts of user group loyalty\n\nIn B2B Loyalty, an org is identified as an entity.\n\nAn individual can be part of multiple groups.\n\nYou can configure the total number of groups that a member can be part of.\n\nThe parent control or the admin role can be transferred from one member to another. Permissions to manage group benefits.\n\nA member of a group can still make individual transactions.\n\nAll the members in a group can pool in their transactions for a tier upgrade.\n\nPoints return and downgrade checks are supported in case of transaction return.\n\nBoth the group and the individual can be incentivized when they transact while representing the group.\n\nUse Cases\n\nFollowing are the different scenarios where user group loyalty is applicable.\n\nNew Terminologies\n\n1. Company : Any business entity which is enrolled in the brand’s B2B loyalty program.\n\nSub-company : A smaller business entity associated with a Company. For example, a big company like Tata can be registered as a company while Tata Motors, TCS can be registered as sub-companies.\n\nCustomer Role : Role is used to capture the association between customer and company. A company can have customers in various roles. For example, a company enrolled in a fleet loyalty program of a brand can have customers in various roles like a driver, associate, owner, etc. 3. Customer Hierarchy : Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles.

You're okay with partial input. For instance, typing just part of the mobile number or a fragment of the email ID should still return relevant results.\n\nSolution\n\nYou can create a search filter with mobile OR email OR external ID condition. This is useful when you don’t have the full details but still want to pull up the right customer profile using whatever you’ve got.\n\nUse Case 2: Exact Match with AND Conditions\n\nYou want to search for a customer using a combination of details— first name , date of birth , and city . In this case, you're doing a full search. You’ll enter the complete first name (e.g., Frodo ), the full date of birth, and the full city name (e.g., Mount Doom ). No partials.\n\nSolution\n\nYou can create a search filter with first name AND date of birth AND city (requires exact match). This approach is ideal when you want to narrow down the results to an exact individual based on multiple known fields.\n\nUse Case 3: Exact Match with Optional Filter\n\nYou want to search for a customer using first name , date of birth , and city . These are your primary fields and require an exact match. Additionally, you want to refine the search further using the zip code —but this field is optional.

After creating a search filter, you can use the Copy cURL feature to import it into the API tool and run it.\n\nCore Concepts\n\nWhat is a Search Filter?\n\nA search filter is a set of one or more indexed fields used to quickly look up data. You define which fields to search on—this setup is called the search filter .\n\nThere are two types of filters:\n\nAND filter – Returns results only when all the conditions are met\n\nOR filter – Returns results when any of the conditions are met (available only for the Customer entity)\n\nOnce the filter is set, the system knows how to query the database efficiently. You can then use the Search API to fetch the results.\n\nKey Features\n\nDefine the fields to search on—including custom and extended fields\n\nSet the time range for the data you want to query\n\nSupports partial search (starts with) for customer records\n\nWorks across multiple languages\n\nCompatible with the Vulcan UI framework (but not limited to it)\n\nChoose which fields appear in the search results; use Neo for advanced customization\n\nUnderstanding Cardinality\n\nWhen creating a search filter, the system first checks the cardinality of the fields you've selected. Filters with high cardinality are more likely to pass validation and be activated.\n\nHigh Cardinality means the field (or combination of fields) has a large number of unique values. This makes it a strong candidate for indexing and searching. Example: Bill number —each value is likely unique.\n\nHigh Cardinality means the field (or combination of fields) has a large number of unique values. This makes it a strong candidate for indexing and searching. Example: Bill number —each value is likely unique.\n\nLow Cardinality means the field has only a few unique values. These fields aren’t ideal for filtering on their own. Example: Gender —only a handful of values like Male, Female, Other. A filter with only this field will likely fail validation.\n\nLow Cardinality means the field has only a few unique values. These fields aren’t ideal for filtering on their own. Example: Gender —only a handful of values like Male, Female, Other.

To enable this, raise a JIRA ticket to product support.\n\nExcluding card merging during account merge\n\nBy default, when merging customer accounts, the cards associated with the victim account are transferred to the survivor account automatically. In case the customer exceeds the set threshold for the maximum number of cards they can hold, the transfer of cards from a victim to a survivor account will proceed with a warning.\nHowever, if you want do not want to transfer the cards of the victim account to the survivor account during a customer merge, you can raise a ticket and disable the CONF_ALLOW_CARD_TRANSFER_TO_SURVIVOR configuration. This ensures that the cards are not transferred along with the other existing parameters.\n\nThere is no UI to enable this configuration. You need to raise a JIRA ticket ( sample ticket ) to the sustenance team to enable these configurations. Turn around time is five days.\n\nSkipping secondary identifiers when merging user data\n\nYou can use the CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY configuration to determine whether to skip using secondary identifiers when merging user data. If enabled, the system will not use secondary identifiers when a matching user is found; instead, it will only consider the primary identifier.\n\nThe section below explains the scenarios when the configuration is enabled and disabled.\n\nTerms\n\nCampaign user -  An individual whose identifiers are present in Capillary's Campaign users' list, used for sending campaign messages.\n\nLoyalty user: An individual who is already a customer and enrolled into a loyalty program.\n\nIncoming transaction: An incoming transaction from a new or existing customer.\n\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled\n\nWhen CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled, the campaign user will merge with the loyalty user based on matches with the primary identifier or any other identifier.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Match:\n\nThe system compares the Mobile identifiers.\n\nCampaign User has Mobile (M1) and the incoming request has Mobile (M2).\n\nMerge Decision:\n\nThe Campaign User's existing details (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) will be updated to Email: E1, Mobile: M2.\n\nDepending on the payload passed, this updated user will be considered a loyalty or non-loyalty user.\n\nExample 2:\n\nMatching Process:\n\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\n\nThe system compares the primary identifier (Mobile).\n\nCampaign User has Mobile: M1, but the request has Mobile: M2.\n\nLoyalty User has Mobile: M2, which matches with the request.\n\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\n\nIncoming user data's Email (E1) matches the Campaign User's Email (E1).\n\nHowever, the merge is primarily driven by the primary identifier (Mobile).\n\nMerge Process:\n\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled, the merge considers both primary and secondary identifiers.\n\nCampaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and Loyalty User (Email: NULL, Mobile: M2) are merged.\n\nResult:\n\nCampaign user's Email remains NULL, and Mobile remains M1: Email(NULL), Mobile(M1).\n\nCampaign user's Email remains NULL, and Mobile remains M1: Email(NULL), Mobile(M1).\n\nLoyalty user's Email is updated to E1, and Mobile remains M2: Email(E1), Mobile(M2). After Merging\n\nLoyalty user's Email is updated to E1, and Mobile remains M2: Email(E1), Mobile(M2).\n\nAfter Merging\n\nNote\n\nIf the survivor user's email or mobile is Null (Loyalty user), then the victim (Campaign user) user's email or mobile will merge into a survivor.\n\nExample 3:\n\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Match:\n\nThe system compares the Mobile identifiers.\n\nCampaign User has Mobile (M2) and the incoming request has Mobile (M2).\n\nMerge process\n\nThe merge occurs because the mobile (M2) of the campaign user matches the corresponding data in the incoming transaction user data(M2), and the email (E1) of the loyalty user matches the corresponding data in the incoming transaction user data(E1).\n\nAfter Merging\n\nNote\n\nIf the survivor (Loyalty user) user's email or mobile is null, then the victim (Campaign user) user's email or mobile will merge into the survivor.\n\nThe loyalty user's email remains the same as E1 and mobile changes to M2 because the victim details will be merged into a survivor.\n\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is Enabled\n\nWhen CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the system skips secondary identifiers during the merging process of campaign and loyalty users. In this scenario, merging will not happen based on secondary identifier matches alone. Instead, merging relies on primary identifier matches between campaign and loyalty users.\n\nExample 1:\n\nMatching Process:\n\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the system ignores the secondary identifier (Email) and only considers the primary identifier (Mobile).The Campaign User has Mobile: M1, which does not match the incoming request's Mobile: M2.\n\nMerge Process:\n\nNo existing user with Mobile: M2 is found in the database.\n\nSince the primary identifier (Mobile) does not match any existing user, no merge happens with the Campaign User.\n\nA new loyalty user is created with the provided primary identifier (Mobile: M2).\n\nResult:\n\nCampaign User: Remains unchanged: Email: E1, Mobile: M1.\n\nNew Loyalty User: Created with: Email: NULL, Mobile: M2 (since the incoming request's primary identifier is M2, and secondary identifiers are ignored).\n\nAfter Merging\n\nExample 2:\n\nMatching Process: Primary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\n\nThe system looks at the primary identifier (Mobile).\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches with the Loyalty User's Mobile: M2.\n\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\nEven though CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, Customer 3's Email: E1 matches the Campaign User's Email: E1.\nHowever, the merge is primarily driven by the primary identifier (Mobile).\n\nMerge Process: Since CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the merge is based on the primary identifier.\nCustomer 3 (Email: E1, Mobile: M2) matches with both the Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2).\n\nResult: The merge happens because the primary identifier (Mobile) matches. Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and Loyalty User (Mobile: M2) are merged.\n\nAfter Merging\n\nNote\n\nIf the survivor user (Loyalty User) has NULL in either email or mobile, the corresponding field from the victim user (Campaign User) will be merged into the survivor.\nIn this case, since the Loyalty User's Email was NULL, it is updated to E1 from the Campaign User.\n\nExample 3:\n\nPrimary Identifier Matching:\n\nThe primary identifier is Mobile.\n\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches Customer 1's Mobile: M2.\n\nSecondary Identifier Matching:\n\nCustomer 3 has Email: E1, which matches Customer 2's Email: E1.\n\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, secondary identifiers should generally be ignored. However, in this case, secondary identifiers still cause a conflict due to the match.\n\nMerging process:\n\nThe system identifies that Customer 3's Email (E1) matches Customer 2's Email, and Mobile (M2) matches Customer 1's Mobile. The system gives preference to the Loyalty user (Customer 2).\n\nThe attempt to add Customer 3 fails because there is a conflict with existing users, and preference is given to the Loyalty user where the primary identifiers are not a match.\n\nResult:\n\nExample 4:\n\nMatching Process:\n\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\n\nThe system considers the primary identifier (Mobile).\n\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches with the Loyalty User's Mobile: M2.\n\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\n\nDespite CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY being enabled, Customer 3's Email: E1 matches the Campaign User's Email: E1.\n\nHowever, the merge primarily relies on the primary identifier (Mobile).\n\nMerge Process:\n\nDue to CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY being enabled, the merge is based on the primary identifier.\n\nCustomer 3 (Email: E1, Mobile: M2) matches both the Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2).\n\nResult: The merge occurs because the primary identifier (Mobile) matches. The Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2) are merged.\n\nAfter Merging\n\nSkipping custom and extended fields during customer merge\n\nYou can control whether custom fields or extended fields are merged from the victim profile into the survivor profile using the CONF_SKIP_MERGE_HANDLER configuration.\n\nTo skip merging custom fields , set the configuration value to CUSTOM_FIELDS .\n\nTo skip merging extended fields , set the configuration value to EXTENDED_FIELDS .

For instance, if you set this value to 3 hours and a customer registers at 9:00 AM, they will be able to claim loyalty points for non-interested transactions with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.\n\nOne-Step Tagging of a Not-interested Transaction (Retro Transaction)\n\nIn Member Care, org admins can create new retro requests and approve requests submitted through InStore or APIs.\n\nTo tag a not-interested transaction to a registered customer on Member Care, follow these steps.\n\nOn Member Care, navigate to Transaction Requests > Transaction Link .\n\nClick One Step Change .\n\nIn the Search box, enter the mobile number, email ID, or external ID of the customer to which you want to tag a transaction and select the customer from the auto-suggestions drop-down.\n\nIn Select Transaction, enter the not-interested Transaction Number , and Transaction Date .

Click Save Changes .\n\nClick Save .\n\nHandling retro transactions as per original transaction date.\n\nRetroactive transactions, also known as retro transactions, refer to transactions that are applied to a loyalty program account after the transaction has taken place. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase.\n\nRetro case in airlines\n\nRetroactive flight rewards refer to the ability to redeem miles or points for flights that you have already taken. Many airline loyalty programs allow you to retroactively claim rewards for flights that you have taken in the past, as long as you were a member of the loyalty program at the time of travel and you have the necessary documentation (e.g., a copy of your boarding pass or ticket receipt).\n\nTo claim retroactive rewards, you will typically need to contact the airline's customer service department and provide them with your loyalty program account information and the details of your past flights. The process for claiming retroactive rewards can vary by airline.\n\nIt's worth noting that retroactive flight rewards may not be available for all flights or may be subject to certain restrictions, such as blackout dates or limited availability. It's always a good idea to check with the airline to see what your options are for claiming retroactive rewards.\n\nLet's understand with one example:\n\nTake for example, a customer made a flight journey on 20th March but not given loyalty details on that date. Instead, at some point in the future (say 20th april), wishes to avail the benefits of that journey, and so reaches out to customer service for the same. In this case, the processing date (20th April) is more than the transaction date (20th March).\n\nThis might lead to a problem, because the customer might have upgraded/degraded from a tier in this time period. Say, the customer might be on the silver tier on 20th March and Gold tier on 20th April. If the journey is processed as per 20th April, benefits will be given as per the gold slab even though the customer is on the silver slab on the date of the transaction.\n\nLet's understand with one more example:\n\nA brand has the below strategy for tier upgrade. Take 5 international flights in a year and upgrade from silver to gold. Else the customer will be downgraded.\n\nTier upgrade to silver - Jan 1, 23 Tier downgrade/renewal date - Jan 1, 24\n\nNow, let's take the above same scenario, however this time the claim happens in next year.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

This can occur due to a number of factors such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase. Retro transaction allows brands to choose the date to be followed for retro transactions as per their policies.\n\nTo enable retro transactions for your org, contact the Capillary sustenance team.\n\nHandling retro transactions\n\nCapillary handles retro transactions based on the date of the transaction as well as the date of processing. A not-interested transaction can be tagged to the respective customer when the customer registers into the loyalty program within the window period.\n\nFor instance, if a customer took a flight on March 20th but did not provide loyalty details on that date and later reached out to the airline’s customer care to obtain loyalty points, the transaction date is March 20th, and the date on which the loyalty points are processed becomes the date of processing.\n\nTo avail of the airline rewards, the customer can provide flight and loyalty program account information to the airline. The airline then tags the transaction and awards the reward to the customer based on the date of transaction or date of processing.\n\nConfiguring the window period for retro transaction\n\nTo customize the retro transaction window, perform the following:\n\nNavigate to Organisation settings .\n\nNavigate to Systems & Deployment > Intouch POS Configuration > Billing .\n\nOn the Billing configuration page, enter the  value in the CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS textbox to configure the maximum allowed window for a retro transaction.\n\nTo configure buffer time, in the CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS set the value of your choice.\n\nFor instance, if the value is set to 3, the customer registering at 9:00 AM will be able to claim loyalty points for a non-interested transaction with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.\n\nSubmiting transaction tagging request\n\nTransaction tagging request allows you to tag a not-interested transaction into a regular transaction.\n\nPerform the steps below to submit a transaction tagging request:\n\nOn the Member Care homepage, search for the user you want to submit a transaction tagging request.\n\nClick the three-dot menu.\n\nExpand the More actions dropdown, and click Transaction requests .\n\nEnter the non-tagged transaction number and click Search transaction . You can filter the transactions based on date and store.\n\nClick Save .\n\nTransaction linking request is raised successfully.\n\nViewing transaction tagging request\n\nTo view the transaction tagging request, perform the following steps:\n\nOn the Member Care home page sidebar, navigate to Member Care > Requests > Member requests .\n\nClick Transaction claims .\n\nClick the All tab to view all requests.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/connectplus_overview", "title": "Overview", "text": "Overview\n\nThis page provides you an overview about Connect+.\n\nConnect+ is Capillary's user-friendly, no-code integration tool. It empowers you to effortlessly bring data into the Capillary platform from an FTP location and export data from Insights to any FTP location. A set of predefined templates for a number of tasks such as customer registration, transaction management, transfer of files etc. are available and enables you to perform the tasks without the need for a development environment.\n\nBenefits of using Connect+\n\nCreate integrations without coding/developer support. You can use various functionalities and use them together to perform desired actions.\n\nAvoids infrastructure management.\n\nEnables monitoring, viewing reports and troubleshooting.\n\nDecrypt encrypted ingestion data and encrypt before sharing.\n\nIngest CSV files without headers.\n\nWide selection of templates that can help to address a wide range of use cases.\n\nDataflow limits\n\nDefault limit: 300 MB or 2 million records in a single file, whichever is lower.\n\nMaximum tested limit: 650 MB or 5 million records in a single file. The limit can be increased based on approval. For approval, contact the Capilarry support team.\n\nIf there are multiple files to be merged, the above limit applies to one file and not the total limit on all files to be merged together.\n\nUsecases\n\nData ingestion\n\nYou can use the Connect+ templates and create a dataflow that can:\n\nread transaction data from the input CSV file which is stored in the FTP server,\n\ntransform the input file to API JSON format and\n\nadd or update the data using the defined APIs as per the schedule.\n\nExample: Customer add template, Transaction add template, Intouch user add template, data reconciliation template, test and control template etc.\n\nData export or outflow\n\nYou can use Connect+ to export the data present in the org in the format required.\n\nFor example, you can use the appropriate templates and  create a dataflow that can:\n\njoin multiple files and export to a merged file\n\ntransfer files from one FTP location to another\n\nConnect+ does not replace Data Export but extends it by addressing the last-mile operations that cannot be achieved through Data Export.\n\nBulk requests\n\nConnect+ can be used to raise requests in bulk and update the data further based on the approval flow. For example, it can be used to create PII deletion requests in bulk.\n\nData merging\n\nYou can use Connect+  to merge files and add them to the respective organisation. A wide range of Join templates are available to choose from.\n\nData conversion\n\nConnect+ supports data conversion from one format to the other. For example, you can use a CSV to XML file conversion template to convert the data in CSV file format to XML.\n\nConnect+ Data Import versus Data Import feature\n\nTerminologies in Connect+ - Understanding key concepts\n\nWorkspace\n\nA Workspace is an org-level or multi-org-level environment for managing data and enables mapping of one or more InTouch organizations to it. It helps ingest the data from different sources into the org-level tables in the Capillary database. The Workspace is created by Connect+ administrators. To select your workspace, click the dropdown next to Connect+, and select your org from the list.\n\nDataflow\n\nA dataflow in Connect+ is a defined sequence of steps or operations that you set up to collect data from a defined source, transform, or process data and transfer it to a defined location. It's essentially a workflow specifically designed for handling data. Dataflows in Connect+ can be used to automate tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and integration between various systems and data sources.\n\nEach workspace can have one or more Dataflows.\n\nExample: An Add transaction dataflow that can connect to a source, process data and add to the Capillary platform.\n\nTemplates\n\nTemplates in Connect+ are pre-defined configurations or patterns that you can use as a starting point for creating dataflows or integration workflows within the Connect+ platform. These templates are designed to simplify the process of setting up common data integration tasks and processes. You can select a template that matches your use case and create a dataflow.\n\nFor example, if you frequently need to import data from a specific type of source system into your organization's database, Connect+ might offer a template for that type of integration, making it easier for you to configure the dataflow without having to build it entirely from scratch.\n\nBlocks in Connect+ templates\n\nThe blocks in Connect+ templates are the building blocks of dataflow, helping connect to a source such as FTP and a destination such as an API, transform or filter data, merge files, and so on.\n\nThese blocks are predefined steps or operations that are part of the template's workflow. They represent specific tasks or functions that need to be performed as part of the data integration or workflow process. The building blocks make up the template's logic and determine what the template does and how it behaves.\n\nHere are some common examples of blocks that you might find in Connect+ templates:\n\nConnect to Source Block: Used to specify the source of the data that needs to be ingested or transferred, such as connecting to a database, an FTP server, or a cloud storage service.\n\nConnect to Source Block: Used to specify the source of the data that needs to be ingested or transferred, such as connecting to a database, an FTP server, or a cloud storage service.\n\nDecrypt Block: Utilized for decrypting source files, particularly if they are encrypted.\n\nDecrypt Block: Utilized for decrypting source files, particularly if they are encrypted.\n\nData Transformation Block: Defines how the data should be transformed or manipulated before it's moved to the destination. This can include tasks like data mapping or converting data formats.\n\nData Transformation Block: Defines how the data should be transformed or manipulated before it's moved to the destination.

If this condition is met, it returns true.\n\n:or is a logical OR operator used to combine conditions. In this case, it checks whether the previous condition is true OR the following condition is true.\n\n${header_value:equals('refunded')} checks if the value of the header_value header is equal to the string 'refunded'. If this condition is met, it returns true.\n\nSo, the entire expression checks if the header_value header is equal to either 'paid' OR 'refunded'. You can use this to filter or process data accordingly.\n\nFor more information on expressions in Connect+, refer to Know about expressions in Connect+ .\n\nUpdated 2 months ago"}

'+91'.concat('hdr{Mobile_No}') : 'hdr{Mobile_No}' }\n\nExample 2: Check if an item is returned. If yes, set transaction type value as 'RETURN' else  set it to 'REGULAR'.\n\nHeaders: Is_Returned (Possible values 'true' / 'false')\n\nExpression: exp{ ('yes'.equalsIgnoreCase('hdr{Is_Returned}')) ? 'RETURN' : 'REGULAR' }\n\nComplex expressions\n\nExample\n\nScenario: Calculating non-fractional qualified quantity based on product category\n\nDescription: In this scenario, we want to compute the qualified quantity based on the product category. If the product category is one of FUEL, JEWEL, or METAL, then the qualified quantity is determined by taking the difference between LineItem_Amount and LineItem_Discount and dividing it by LineItem_Rate. However, if the product category falls outside of these categories, the qualified quantity defaults to LineItem_Qty.\n\nHeaders: Product_Category, LineItem_Discount, LineItem_Amount, LineItem_Rate, LineItem_Qty\n\nExpression:\nexp{ ({'FUEL','JEWEL','METAL'}.contains('hdr{Product_Category}') ) ? T(Math).floor( (hdr{LineItem_Amount} - hdr{LineItem_Discount}) / hdr{LineItem_Rate}) : T(Math).floor(hdr{LineItem_Qty}) }\n\nThis expression employs conditional logic to ensure accurate calculation of the qualified quantity based on the specified conditions and input data.\n\nUsing SpEL expressions in data transformation\n\nIn the data transformation block, you can use expressions for the following:\n\nFiltering data\n\nMapping attribution identifier type\n\nMapping header that has consistent values\n\nFiltering data\n\nYou can use filter expression to filter the data that needs to be processed.\n\nConsider a transaction dataflow that includes a Financial status header with values such as paid, refunded, or not paid.\n\nTo exclusively process dataflow for transactions that are either paid or not paid, in the Transformation block, you can use the filter expression ${header_value:equals('paid'):or(${header_value:equals('not paid')})} . This expression should be entered in the Filter tab within the transformation text box.\n\nMapping attribution identifier type\n\nEvery transaction or customer addition is linked to a specific store or till. The details of these stores or tills are configured in the attribution block. Here, you have the flexibility to use expressions to define constant values for the identifier type.\n\nFor example, consider the scenario of a customer addition dataflow and the store code information is found under the 'SC_NUMBER' column in the source file. Here, you would set the identifierType as 'STORE_CODE' and map the identifierValue to the 'SC_NUMBER' column.\n\nIn this case, use the expression const{STORE_CODE} in the identifierType field and specify 'SC_NUMBER' as the identifierValue. This setup ensures that the attribution of 'STORE CODE' is consistently associated with the 'SC_NUMBER' column in your data.\n\nMapping header that has consistent values\n\nConsider a scenario where you're adding transaction data using the \"add transaction dataflow,\" and all the transactions share the same currency code, INR. The challenge here is that there's no specific header column in the source file indicating the currency code; instead, this information was conveyed via email.\n\nIn this situation, you can map the header to the API field by performing the following:\n\nAdd a new column to your source file with the header \"Currency Code\".\n\nPopulate this new column with the value \"INR\" for all transactions.\n\nMap this \"Transaction Type\" header to the API field currencyCode .\n\nThis way, you explicitly specify that the currency code for all transactions is INR. However, there's a more efficient way to achieve this using an expression.\n\nSimplify with expressions\n\nYou can streamline this process by using the expression const{INR} in the API field currencyCode . This expression communicates that the value for the API field currencyCode is consistently \"INR\" for all transaction data. This approach eliminates the need for additional columns and simplifies the mapping process.\n\nAvoiding common errors in expression\n\nThe examples below can help you to avoid errors when working with the MVEL expressions.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

It is used to divide a single API response containing multiple objects into distinct parts. This is particularly useful for APIs that return a collection of results, such as successes and failures, within a single response. For example, using the expression $.result.errors.data._,$.result.success.data._ groups the success data under one object and error data under another. Example response below:\n\n{ \"result\": { \"success\": { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"123\", \"status\": true, \"message\": \"Customer created successfully\" }, { \"id\": \"456\", \"status\": true, \"message\": \"Order placed successfully\" } ][ { \"id\": \"123\", \"status\": true, \"message\": \"Customer created successfully\" }, { \"id\": \"456\", \"status\": true, \"message\": \"Order placed successfully\" } ] }, \"errors\": { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"789\", \"status\": false, \"code\": \"E101\", \"message\": \"Invalid address\" } ][ { \"id\": \"789\", \"status\": false, \"code\": \"E101\", \"message\": \"Invalid address\" } ] } } }\n\nRecoverable Error Codes\n\nSpecific error codes that indicate situations in which the system should attempt to retry the failed operation. For example, you can error codes such as - 502 Bad Gateway, 504 Gateway Timeout, 520 Unknown Error, 521 Web Server Is Down etc.\n\nParse Path Map\n\nLets you define expressions to parse the status message and error code from your API response, and include them in the error file. This is crucial since API responses can have varying structures for error information. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates. Ex: {\"status_code\": \"$.error.code\", \"error_message\": \"$.error.message\",\"displayLabel\": \"$.error.displayLabel\"}\n\nYielding Error Codes\n\nError codes that will be retried an unlimited number of times. This strategy is usually reserved for specific error types where the expectation is that the issue will eventually resolve without intervention, but it might take an indefinite amount of time. Example: When a \"429\" error (indicating that the request rate is too high) is encountered, the system configured with this strategy will retry the request indefinitely until it is successful. This is because the rate limit is expected to eventually lift, allowing the request to proceed.\n\nMax Retries\n\nDefines the maximum number of attempts to make an API request in case of failures. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates.\n\nAdditional headers\n\nApplicable only for certain templates. This enables the auto-approval for the request.

Enter the below details:\n\nField\n\nDescription\n\nFiles 1-2 Join Types\n\nEnables you to select the type of SQL join command.\n\nInner join -  An Inner Join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined. For example, suppose you have two tables: \"Line item table\" and \"Bill level table,\" and you want to determine which items were purchased in each bill and calculate the total cost of each item in every bill. When you use the Inner Join option, the merged table will include only the records that have matching BillNumbers in both data sources.\n\nInner join -  An Inner Join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined. For example, suppose you have two tables: \"Line item table\" and \"Bill level table,\" and you want to determine which items were purchased in each bill and calculate the total cost of each item in every bill. When you use the Inner Join option, the merged table will include only the records that have matching BillNumbers in both data sources.\n\nLeft outer join - A Left Outer Join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. For example, consider two tables: \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" When you use a Left Outer Join, you retrieve all customer records along with any matching order records. If a customer has no orders, the customer record is still included with NULL values in the order-related columns.\n\nLeft outer join - A Left Outer Join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. For example, consider two tables: \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" When you use a Left Outer Join, you retrieve all customer records along with any matching order records. If a customer has no orders, the customer record is still included with NULL values in the order-related columns.\n\nRight outer join - A Right Outer Join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. For example, consider two tables: \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" When you perform a Right Outer Join, you retrieve all order records along with any matching customer records. If an order has no associated customer, the order record is still included with NULL values in the customer-related columns.\n\nRight outer join - A Right Outer Join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.

By default, the delimiter is a comma (,).\n\nFile 1 Regex\n\nEnter the name of your first file here in the format filename_.*.fileformat . The asterisk represents the wildcard.\n\nFor example, for the system to search for files that begin with the name \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE\" followed by any sequence of characters you can enter the file name as \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE.*.csv\". This will enable the system to locate files that match this pattern.\n\n*NOTE:** The file works in an FCFS manner. The files that are uploaded first and second are merged first.\n\nFile 2 Regex\n\nEnter the name of your second file in the format: filename.*.fileformat . The asterisk represents the wildcard.\n\nFor example, for the system to search for files that begin with the name \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE\" followed by any sequence of characters you can enter the file name as \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE.*.csv\". This will enable the system to locate files that match this pattern.\n\n*NOTE **: The file works in an FCFS manner. The files that are uploaded first and second are merged first.\n\nFile 1 Headers\n\nEnter the column header name of File 1 that needs to be compared.\n\nThis is compared with the column headers in the File 2. To match columns based on multiple headers, enter the header names separated by a comma.\n\nFile 2 Headers\n\nEnter the column header name of File 2 that needs to be compared.\n\nThis is compared with the column headers in the File 1. To match columns based on multiple headers, enter the header names separated by a comma.\n\nFile Join Use Case\n\nFrom the dropdown, select TRANSACTION_LINE_ITEM. This is an inner join operation where one row in the bill maps to multiple line items.\n\n*NOTE:**The option None is not applicable.\n\nOutput Filename\n\nEnter the output filename.\n\nBy default, the filename format is merge_yyy-mm-dd, where merge is the file name, yyyy-mm-dd is the year month, and date on which the file is created.\n\nAlphabetical Sort\n\nSelect this check box to ensure accurate sorting of the files in alphanumerical order. By default, this is always enabled. NOTE: It is recommended to always select the checkbox before proceeding further.\n\nMerge based on common Name\n\nMake sure that this check box is always selected.\n\nThis makes sure that the system identifies the correct files to be merged.\n\nMerge based on common name Template File One\n\nEnter the filename using the <common> tag.\n\nFor example, if there are files with names TktABC.dat *, and TktDocument_ABC.dat , and if you enter the value as TktDocument*<common>.dat, the system looks for the file and selects TktDocument_ABC.dat for merging. ABC is the common tag among the files.\n\nMerge based on common Name Template File Two\n\nEnter the filename using the <common> tag.\n\nFor example, if there are files with names TktABC.dat and TktDocument_ABC.dat , and if you enter the value as TktDocument <common>.dat, the system looks for the file and selects TktDocument_ABC.dat for merging. ABC is the common tag among the files.\n\nFile One is Headerless\n\nSelect the check box if the columns in file one do not have a header.\n\nFile Two is Headerless\n\nSelect the check box if the columns in file two do not have a header.\n\nFile One Mention Header names\n\nDefine the heading order of the columns in fIle one separated by commas.\n\nFile Two Mention Header names\n\nDefine the heading order of the columns in fIle two separated by commas.\n\nMatch All Regex\n\nSelect True from the dropdown to keep only the matching files in the server and delete the files that are not matched.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/data-validation-block", "title": "Data Validation Block", "text": "Data Validation Block\n\nThe Data Validation block ensures data quality by cleaning, validating, and preparing information before moving to the next step in a workflow. Typically, it acts as a middle step, placed after a source or decrypt block and before an API call block. The block is optional and available in both Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and standard templates.\n\nThe block runs a Databricks job, identified by its job ID, to process incoming data. The job reads the input file retrieved from the source block, converts it into a temporary table, applies the required validations and transformations, and writes the results to an output table. The output table then serves as the data source for field mapping in subsequent blocks.\n\nKey capabilities\n\nThe Data Validation block prepares your data before it moves downstream. You can use it to:\n\nFilter data: Keep only the records that meet specific conditions.\n\nFilter data: Keep only the records that meet specific conditions.\n\nRemove duplicates : Eliminate repeated records to retain only one copy.\n\nRemove duplicates : Eliminate repeated records to retain only one copy.\n\nFill missing values : Add default or random values in required fields to prevent errors later in the workflow.\n\nFill missing values : Add default or random values in required fields to prevent errors later in the workflow.\n\nAdd missing details : Retrieve additional information from other Databricks tables.\n\nAdd missing details : Retrieve additional information from other Databricks tables.\n\nRename headers : Update column names to match the format required by subsequent steps.\n\nRename headers : Update column names to match the format required by subsequent steps.\n\nApply custom rules : Define validation logic in Databricks, such as validating formats or ensuring uniqueness.\n\nApply custom rules : Define validation logic in Databricks, such as validating formats or ensuring uniqueness.\n\nTransform data : Adjust fields, standardize formats, or reorganize records.\n\nTransform data : Adjust fields, standardize formats, or reorganize records.\n\nProcess Overview\n\nThe Data Validation block uses Databricks to apply the capabilities listed above.

Below are its key applications:\n\nUse Case 1: Validate Customer Status Before Processing Transactions\n\nA retail brand wants to award loyalty points only for purchases made by active customers. However, transaction files often include records from inactive or deleted customers, leading to incorrect point allocation.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to check the customer status before processing transactions. Configure a Databricks job that:\n\nConfirms whether the customer is active.\n\nConfirms whether the customer is active.\n\nRejects transactions from inactive or deleted customers with an error reason.\n\nRejects transactions from inactive or deleted customers with an error reason.\n\nAfter validation, only eligible transactions proceed for point allocation.\n\nUse Case 2: Retrotagging for Late Enrollments\n\nCustomers sometimes make purchases before enrolling in the loyalty program. When they sign up later, the brand wants to link the past purchases to the customer’s new account and award points retroactively.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to retrotag earlier transactions. Configure a Databricks job that:\n\nMatches past purchases with the newly created member profile.\n\nMatches past purchases with the newly created member profile.\n\nTags earlier visits against the correct customer account.\n\nTags earlier visits against the correct customer account.\n\nThe validated data is then forwarded for point allocation, ensuring customers are rewarded fairly.\n\nUse Case 3: Enrich Customer Data with Required Identifiers or Append Missing Data\n\nA brand’s transaction files often include basic details such as LoyaltyID or points, but miss Capillary identifiers like user_id or bill_id . In some cases, files include only a mobile number, while downstream API calls require the first and last names.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to enrich incomplete records. Configure a Databricks job that:\n\nLooks up missing Capillary identifiers, for example, user_id , bill_id, and missing information like first and last name from other Databricks tables.\n\nLooks up missing Capillary identifiers, for example, user_id , bill_id, and missing information like first and last name from other Databricks tables.\n\nValidates that the customer exists and is active.\n\nValidates that the customer exists and is active.\n\nThis produces a complete dataset ready for transaction processing.\n\nUse Case 4: Perform Reconciliation and Audit Checks Before Storing Transactions\n\nBefore storing transactions, a retail brand needs to verify store IDs, avoid duplicate entries, and identify suspiciously large bill amounts. Without these checks, errors and fraud may affect reporting and rewards.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to perform reconciliation and audit checks. Configure a Databricks job that:\n\nConfirms store IDs exist in the system.\n\nConfirms store IDs exist in the system.\n\nRejects transactions already recorded.\n\nRejects transactions already recorded.\n\nFlags transactions with unusually high values for further review.\n\nFlags transactions with unusually high values for further review.\n\nThe cleaned data then continues to the next block for storage or processing.\n\nUse Case 5: Filter Data\n\nA retail brand imports a transaction file containing 10,000 records. However, only bills greater than 1,000 rupees are eligible for loyalty points. Without filtering, unnecessary records slow down processing and API calls.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to filter input data. Configure a Databricks job that selects rows with a transaction value greater than 1000 rupees.\n\nOnly qualifying records are returned to Connect+ for further processing.\n\nUse Case 6: Fill Missing Values\n\nInput files sometimes contain null values in mandatory fields such as transaction dates. These gaps cause errors in subsequent API calls.\n\nSolution Use the Data Validation block to fill missing values. Configure a Databricks job that:\n\nReplaces nulls in required fields with default values.\n\nReplaces nulls in required fields with default values.\n\nEnsures mandatory fields are always populated before forwarding the data.\n\nEnsures mandatory fields are always populated before forwarding the data.\n\nThis prevents failures during downstream processing.\n\nUse Case 7: Cleaning Customer Data Before Loyalty Points Allocation\n\nA retail brand uses Capillary’s loyalty platform to allocate points by importing customer data from an external system. However, the incoming file often includes duplicate records and rows with missing mobile numbers, which impacts point allocation.\n\nSolution Use the Validation block in Capillary to clean the data before processing it. Configure a custom Databricks job that:\n\nRemoves duplicate customer records based on email address or mobile number.\n\nEliminates rows where the mobile number is missing.\n\nProvide the Databricks job ID in the Validation block configuration.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/data_reconciliation_template", "title": "Data reconciliation template", "text": "Data reconciliation template\n\nThis template helps to compare source data and the data in the Insight+ backend to identify the data that got missed during ingestion into Capillary.\n\nThe term source data refers to the data that is provided by the client and is considered the source of truth. The source data can be a .csv file or any other data format and contains events such as transactions or customer registrations.\n\nThe purpose of comparing source data with data ingested into the Capillary platform is to identify any missing events that may have failed to be ingested due to various reasons. The process of comparing the source data with the data in Capillary platform is known as data reconciliation and is important for ensuring accurate reporting and downstream events, particularly for loyalty customers.\n\nUse case\n\nConsider that on January 1st, 2022, there were 100 transaction events that were expected to be captured in the Capillary platform. However, due to certain issues or errors, only 90 events were successfully recorded in the platform, resulting in 10 missing events. These 10 missing events need to be identified and ingested into the platform.\n\nWith data reconciliation dataflow, you can compare the source data with the transactions in Insights+ backend and identify the missing data.\n\nConfiguring data reconciliation dataflow\n\nTo configure data reconciliation dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\n\nIn the Connect to source Block , enter the source server details where the source data is present and the location for saving the processed file. See Connect to source .\n\nIn the Map fields for reconciliation block, map the source data fields to the CDP fields to initiate comparison and identify missing data. See Map fields for reconciliation .\n\nIn the Trigger frequency block, set the trigger frequency. See Trigger frequency .\n\nMap fields for reconciliation\n\nIn this section, you need to map the fields in the source data to the fields in the Capillary platform. At present, the following transaction types of data can be compared with the Capillary platform.\n\nRegular transaction line items - To compare and identify missing regular transactions in the Capillary platform. 📘 Map multiple fields to identify the unique transaction If a transaction contains multiple line items with the same bill number but with different codes, and if you map only the bill number,  when the system compares the source data with the data in the platform, it matches only the bill number and considers the transaction as already available in the platform. If you map the bill number and other fields such as store code, year, bill date, rate etc, the system matches properly and identifies the missing transaction accordingly. See the below image for an example of a transaction with the same bill number repeated multiple times but one among those appears against a different store code. In this case, if you map only the bill number, the system matches only the bill number and if a transaction with the respective bill number is available in the platform, after processing, it marks all transactions with that bill number as 1 (data already available in the system/not missing data).\n\nMap multiple fields to identify the unique transaction\n\nIf a transaction contains multiple line items with the same bill number but with different codes, and if you map only the bill number,  when the system compares the source data with the data in the platform, it matches only the bill number and considers the transaction as already available in the platform.\n\nIf you map the bill number and other fields such as store code, year, bill date, rate etc, the system matches properly and identifies the missing transaction accordingly.\n\nSee the below image for an example of a transaction with the same bill number repeated multiple times but one among those appears against a different store code. In this case, if you map only the bill number, the system matches only the bill number and if a transaction with the respective bill number is available in the platform, after processing, it marks all transactions with that bill number as 1 (data already available in the system/not missing data).\n\nReturn transaction line items - To compare and identify missing return transactions in the Capillary platform. Similar to regular transaction line items, it is recommended to map multiples to identify the unique transaction.\n\nCustomer - To compare and identify missing customer data in the Capillary platform.\n\nProduct - To compare and identify missing product data in the Capillary platform.\n\nTo map the field names, in the Transformation text box, enter the Capillary data field name against the corresponding source data field name ( API field) . For example, if the source data field name for the field that contains billing data information is Billing data , in the Transformation text box, enter the Capillary data field name where you have the same information.\n\nIf you want to map the date fields, from the Date format drop-down, select the desired date format.\n\nIn the From year field, enter the year from which you want to compare the data. By default, it will compare source data with the platform data from the previous year to the present date. If you enter a year, for example, 2016,  it will compare source data with platform data from 2016 up to the current year. This option is available to speed up the comparison process.\n\nIn the Reconciliation Results Directory field, enter the directory where you need to save the processed data. In the processed file. If the URL is /APAC2Cluster/EUConnect, enter only the path APAC2Cluster/EUConnect in the Reconciliation Results Directory field. You can use this file to ingest the missing data to the Capillary platform. In the output file, the application creates a CAP_API_STATUS column and in the column, the missing data is marked as 0 and the existing data is marked as 1.\n\nIngestion of the missing data\n\nTo ingest the missing data, perform the following\n\nUse the respective data flow template and in the connect to source, enter the Reconciliation Results Directory path in the Source Directory field. For example, if you want to add a missing transaction, enter the output file path of the Data reconciliation template in the source directory of the transaction add template.\n\nIn the filter header field, enter the heading CAP_API_STATUS . This is the status column header in the processed file of the reconciliation dataflow.\n\nIn the Filter-Data , define the Filter Condition as ${header_value:equals(0)} . This enables the template to ingest the rows that are marked as missing (0).\n\nNOTE\n\nThe insights+ backend data has a lag of one day. ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) runs only once every night (according to org time zone).\n\nIf you are running reconciliation dataflow on daily basis, make sure that you schedule the trigger with a gap of  12-24 hours after the ETL completion. Triggering the dataflow before the ETL completion can result in  the system condidering the new data as missing data and ingessting it.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

This allows you to migrate customers from other platforms who have expired badges or badges that were assigned in the past but are still active.\n\nExample 1: If a brand is migrating expired badges from Platform A, they can use this header to recreate 20 badges that were active in 2023. Example 2 : If a brand is migrating in September 2024 with 50 active badges that originally started on January 1st, 2024, they can use this header to ensure these badges are created in the Capillary system with their correct start date, preserving their ongoing status.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

The data includes details like passenger information, flight completion status, and other relevant metadata. This data is sent in bulk every hour, reaching up to 1,000 requests per minute. Due to the high volume and frequency, the PSS streams this data into a Kafka queue.\n\nThe system needs a reliable and scalable way to:\n\nContinuously consume data from the Kafka queue\n\nTransform it into a format that Capillary’s platform can process\n\nForward the processed data for downstream use, such as awarding loyalty points or updating customer profiles\n\nSolution\n\nUse the \"Ingest from Kafka Stream\" template in Connect+ to build a Kafka consumer that retrieves and processes data efficiently.\n\nThis setup will:\n\nConnect to the specified Kafka topic using OAuth-based credentials\n\nConsume messages in real time as they arrive in the Kafka queue\n\nTransform the incoming payloads using a JavaScript-based transformer to match Capillary's expected schema\n\nForward the transformed data to the appropriate platform APIs for processing (e.g., behavioral event ingestion, customer updates)\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe following are the prerequisites for using the Ingest Kafka Stream in API:\n\nName of the Kafka server\n\nKafka topic\n\nConsumer group ID\n\nUsername and password to access the Kafka server.\n\nConfiguring Ingest Kafka stream in API\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the template, showing the various blocks.\n\nTo configure Ingest Kafka stream in API template, the following are the steps:\n\nIn the Connect-to-source-kafka block, enter the Kafka details, including the server address, Kafka topic, username, and password from where the events are imported. For the information on configuring this block, refer to Connect-to-source-kafka .\n\nIn the neo-Transformer block, enter the URL of the Neo dataflow created to transform the data required as per your requirement. For the information on configuring this block, refer to neo-Transformer .\n\nIn the Connect-to-destination enter the details of the API endpoint. For the information on configuring this block, refer to Connect to destination .\n\nConnect-to-source-kafka\n\nThis block enables you to define the Kafka server details. Below is the screenshot showing the fields in the block.\n\nThe table below describes the fields in the block:\n\nField Name\n\nDescription\n\nkafka brokers\n\nKafka server URL. The URL is a combination of the server address and the port number.\n\nExample *: kafka-connectplus:9092\n\nkafka topics\n\nPredefined topic name from which you consume messages. These topics must already exist in your Kafka system. You can list multiple topics separated by commas.\n\nConsumer Group Id\n\nSpecifies the predefined consumer group ID used for access control.\n\nSecurity Protocol\n\nSpecify the security protocol you want to use to exchange data between the Kafka client and server. The supported protocols are:\n\nPLAINTEXT :  No data encryption or authentication.\n\nSSL : Uses the SSL protocol for data encryption but no SASL authentication.\n\nSASL_PLAINTEXT : Uses SASL protocol for authentication but does not encrypt data.\n\nSASL_SSL : Uses the SASL protocol for authentication and SSL for encryption.\n\nSASL Mechanism\n\nSpecify the authentication method used to connect to Kafka. The supported mechanisms are:\n\nGSSAPI\n\nPLAIN\n\nSCRAM-SHA-256\n\nUsername and Password\n\nUsername and password to access the Kafka server.\n\nHeaders as Attribute\n\nHeaders from the Kafka message contain metadata like user-id, priority, and source-system. These headers are extracted as data attributes and are available for all the steps in Connect+. The headers are required for the following:\n\nRouting:  Direct the messages based on headers\n\nFiltering: Process only the relevant messages\n\nTracking: Use for obervability and tracking\n\nSimplified Logic: Apply  business logic without needing to parse the main message.\n\nneo-Transformer\n\nThe Neo Transformer block allows you to call a NEO dataflow for data transformation. Below is the screenshot showing the fields in the block.\n\nThe table below describes the fields in the block.\n\nField Name\n\nDescription\n\nEnter url\n\nSelect the\n\nNeo Dataflow\n\nfrom the drop-down menu. The drop-down lists Dataflows with the Connectplus tag.\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorisation key for the API (if required).\n\nSplit Response\n\nSplits the response when the API returns an array of objects.\n\n*True **- Separates each array element in the API response into individual responses\n\n*False **- Keeps the response as a single array without separation\n\nUpdated 28 days ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/data-import-", "title": "Data import", "text": "Data import\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Data Import Framework is a web application that helps to upload offline data generated at the stores to the Capillary Database.\n\nWhen InStore is operated online, it continuously syncs the data generated at the PoS to the Capillary Database. However, in cases where data is not captured through InStore but saved in the PoS machines, you can use the Data Import Framework to upload such data to the Capillary Database.\n\nBased on the size of the data, you can import data in two ways:\n\nImport directly: If the number of entries in the CSV file are less than 700,000, you can directly upload the data (.csv) file in Data Import Framework.\n\nImport through an FTP server: If the number of entries in the csv file are from 700,000 to 1,000,000, you need to import data from an FTP server. For this, you need to provide read/write access to a specific directory of the FTP Server and schedule the import job on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.\n\nThe data corresponding to each activity type will be grouped as a category called profiles.  Data Import Framework lets you import the data of activities provided in the following section.\n\nCan I restrict the number of entries in an import job?\n\nData Import Framework lets you limit the entries to import for each profile through templates. Create a template for the profile and set the limit. When configuring an import job, choose the desired profile template.\n\nYou can check the detailed status of an import job on the Import File Details page.\n\nThrough direct import, you can choose only one file at a time. However, you can import multiple files at a time through FTP.\n\nCSV files for different profiles\n\nBefore importing data, keep the CSV files ready for each profile that you want to import. Each file should contain entries of the corresponding profile. There are mandatory and optional fields for each profile. Fields that are marked by * are mandatory.\n\nA customer identifier can be a mobile number, email ID, or external ID.\n\nIn addition to the profile fields, you can also have custom fields for your organization.\n\nThe organization could have additional mandatory fields excluding the ones mentioned herein. For example, mandatory custom fields.\n\nFor direct import, the number of entries in a CSV file should not exceed 7L entries and for import through FTP, the number of entries should be between 7L-10L.\n\nThe maximum size allowed for an FTP import is 200MB.\n\nThe following table provides the reference links for each entity type available in import type (profiles)\n\nEntity\n\nSupported Profiles\n\nReference links\n\nCustomer\n\nIdentifier Cleanup\nLoyalty Customers\nUser Subscription\nCoupon Redemption\nCard Import\nCard Series Import\nCard Status Update & Linking Import\nCustomer Status Import\nEntity lifecycle\nFraud Status Migration to customer status\nHistorical points import\nLoyalty Customers\nSubscription service new\nUpdate fraud status\nV2 profile identifier (Add/Update)\n\nCustomer Profile\n\nInventory\n\nInventory\nInventory Updates for Line-items\nBrands\nCategory\nOrg colors import\nAttributes\n\nInventory Profile\n\nOrg Entities\n\nAdmin Users\nAttribution Lookup Import\nConcepts\nOrg currency ratio import\nOrg entity status update\nStore add ons\nZones\nStores\nStore Server\nStore TILLs\n\nOrg Entities\n\nPoints & Slabs\n\nBill Points promotion (Accrual)\nRedeem Points\nSlab\n\nPoints & Slabs\n\nPoints Deduction\n\nBill Promotion Expiry\nCustomer Promotion Expiry\nTransactions Bills Deduction\n\nPoints deductions\n\nTransactions\n\nLoyalty Transactions\nTransactions (Not-Interested)\nExtended Fields Import\nTransaction Dump\nLoyalty Transaction Line Items\nUpdate Outlier Status (Loyalty Transactions)\nUpdate Outlier Status (Not-Interested Transactions)\nNot-Interested Transaction Line items\nTransaction (Returns)\n\nTransactions\n\nTrackers and Promotional Rewards\n\nTrackers\nPromotional Rewards\n\nTrackers\n\nPromotional Rewards\n\nData Cleanup\n\nIdentifier Cleanup\n\nLifetime Purchases Recalculation\n\nData cleanup\n\nConfiguring for directly uploading an import file\n\nOnce you create the data file required for the current import job, you can import it to the Capillary database using the 6 steps provided in the following.\n\nThe following are the important points to consider before starting with import.\n\n*The mentioned time period is in\n\nIST for APAC & APAC2 cluster\n\nCST for China cluster;\n\nGMT for EU cluster\n\nFirst, create a CSV file based on the purpose of the import. Each purpose is associated with a different profile. For example, register customers, add transactions, issue points, add inventory, and so on. You need to create CSV files according to profiles.\n\nBefore uploading the file, ensure that no invalid entries are present in the file.  To make this process easy, sort columns by mobile number and transaction date wherever applicable\n\nTo know more about different fields supported for each profile, see Profiles, Supported Fields, and Template Configuration.\n\nOnce you create a file, upload it via. Import Framework.\n\nOn the Settings page, click Master Data Management > Data Import\n\nClick Data Import.

Write the merge function in the Transformer Inputs box.\nColumns=>x,y,z or Columns=>2,3,4;Separator=>[] where x, y and z are column numbers.\nFor example, if Column=>1,2,3 is set then the text in the columns 1, 2, 3 will be merged to a single field separating each column with a comma (,), a default value.\nYou can set any delimiter for merging two or more columns using the Separator=> function.\nFor example, if Column=>1,2,3;Separator=>; is set in Transformer Inputs , the columns 1, 2 and 3 will be merged separating the value of each column with a semicolon.\n\nDefault Value\n\nReplaces null values present in the column with a value specified in Transformer Inputs.\nValue=>[Any Value].\nFor example, if Value=>store.server is set in Transformer Inputs , all null values identified in the column will be replaced with 'store.server'\n\nConvert to Date & Time\n\nChanges the date and time format across the column. This is applicable only to the columns with date and time.\nSet the standard date and time format in the Transformer Inputs box. Date parameters\n\nd - Day of the month (1-31)\n\nm - Month (1-12)\n\nY - Year in four digits (example: 2013)\n\ny: Year (13) Time Parameters\n\nH: Hours (24hr format)\n\ns: Seconds\n\nh: 12 hour format(1-12)\n\ni: Minutes (00 - 60)\nThe parameters of date and time format can be used in any order. For example, date can be set as d/m/Y or m/d/Y or Y/m/d. However, it is recommended to use the standard date and time format of the organization.\n\nExpression\n\nThis function lets you apply some mathematical calculations on two or more columns. Exp=>{Column no. of A} {+ or - or *or /} {Column no. of B}\nFor example, if the expression is set to Exp=>{1}{2}-10,\nAll null values of that column will be replaced with - (value of that field will be (value of column 1) * (value of column2) - 10).\nYou can use this function only on columns with integer values but not for string data types.\n\nNote:\n\nIf the date format in the file is in the form YYYY-MM-DD hh:ii:ss, then date formatting is not required.\n\nSelect Not Null only for the fields that are not supposed to be empty. If any null values are identified for those particular fields, an error report will be generated with the entire list of null values.\n\nOptions for each configuration varies based on the org and profile selected\n\nApart from the standard fields, you can also import custom fields and map with the respective column of the CSV file.

For example, if number 2 is set in this field then while uploading data to the server the top two rows will not be considered. This can be used when there are field names, duplicate data or blank data in the top rows\n\nIn No. of rows to be ignored from bottom , set the number of rows from the bottom that you want to exclude from importing. For example, if 15 is set, then while importing the last 15 rows will be ignored. You can set this option in case of duplicate/blank/invalid entries in the last rows of the CSV file.\n\nIn File Delimiter ,  type in the character used to separate each value in the file. For example, a file can have either ',' separated or 'tab' separated or ';' separated values. If ','  is mentioned then values will be separated after every ',' found in the file.\n\nIn Enclosure , type the special character used in the file for 'string' data types\n\nIn Escape Character , type in the special character that needs to be ignored from the file\n\nClick Submit\n\nIn the Configure Templates for Data Upload field, choose the desired template for each profile and click Submit .\n\nAs the data size is large, it is recommended to schedule an import job in between 10 pm to 6 am to avoid inconvenience to your stores' operations.\n\nIn Status , choose Running\n\nIn Check for Files , choose the frequency of import - Daily, Weekly, Monthly or on a Fixed Date and set the respective time interval.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/inventory-profiles", "title": "Inventory profiles", "text": "Inventory profiles\n\nThis category lets you import items and product hierarchy according to the organization's product inventory.\n\nYou can have up to four levels above items including brands and categories. For example, if L1, L2, L3, and L4 are four categories from top to bottom level, you can import all categories at a time with a proper mapping or one by one from L1 to L4.  However, it is recommended to use the second case to ensure proper mapping.\n\nIt is important to understand the following points while configuring Profile Templates.\n\nConfiguring Organisation Unit (OU) support for product entities\n\nOrganisation Unit (OU) support for product entities enables you to use the same SKU codes for the different OUs under an organisation.\n\nBy default, transactions are tagged under OU. This is achieved by linking the stores where transactions occur to corresponding zones or concepts, and categorizing these zones or concepts as OUs.\n\nUse case\n\nIn your organizational setup, there are multiple organizational units (OUs) in place. By default, any inventory that's uploaded to the main organization is automatically shared among all these individual OUs.\n\nHowever, let's consider a situation where a particular org unit requires its own separate inventory. This necessity arises due to conflicts noticed between the SKU codes it utilizes and those uploaded by other org units.\n\nIn such scenarios, you have the option to enable the \"OU support for product entities\" configuration. This configuration allows the creation of distinct inventories that are specific to each specific organizational unit.\n\nEnabling OU support for product entities\n\nTo enable OU support for product entities, create a JIRA ticket and enable the config CONF_OU_LEVEL_PRODUCTS_ENABLED .`\n\nProduct category\n\nA product category is used to classify different types of products. For example, smartphones can be categories as “foldables”, “big screen”, “small screen”, “camera phone”.\n\nYou will have item code by default which is the lowest level. You can add up to four levels above the item code.\n\nAssume L4, L3, L2, L1, L0 as different levels where L0 is item code and L4 is the super parent. You need to first import a parent category followed by child category.\n\nYou can make a super parent category a root category using the option Mark parent category as root if not mapped for existing categories.\n\nThis profile lets you update existing categories of a brand or add new child categories. To use this profile, the org should have at least one parent category under it.\n\nCategory Code\n\nParent Category Code\n\nCategory Name\n\nCategory Description Leave the Parent Category Code blank for parent categories and specify the respective parent category code for child categories.\n\nCSV Sample:\n\nCategory Code,Parent Category Code, Category Name,Category Description Shirts,Apparels,categoryName,Men Apparels\n\nConfiguring Template\n\nAdd the fields that you want to allow updating for the current template, Any field that you did not add here will be ignored even if you do the field mapping\n\nSelect Mark parent category as root if not mapped for new categories, to enable converting a new category parent if not mapped any parent category\n\nSelect Mark parent category as root if not mapped for existing categories, to convert existing categories - that are not mapped to any parent category - as parent categories\n\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU.  For more information, see OU support for product inventory .\n\nSelect the Store access group. For more information on the access group, see Access group .\n\nClick Submit to save the template.\n\nMark parent category as root if not mapped for new categories: Check this option to make new parent categories of the current import as root brands.\n\nMark parent category as root if not mapped for existing categories: Check this option to make existing parent categories as root brands through the current import.\n\nInventory\n\nThis profile allows you to import product inventory for an organization. For this, you need to have categories created for the Org and you can specify values of each category in the data file. To import root categories and brands use the profiles Category and Brands respectively. Please navigate to the respective sections for more details.\n\n_Note: _If any new category is identified in the file that you import, a category is created  without any parent mapping. Hence, if you have new categories, it is recommended to do a category import before importing inventory details.\n\nImportant checklist for inventory import: Before importing inventory\n\nidentify hierarchy levels and new attributes in the file.\n\nItem codes are alpha-numeric and do not have special characters, spaces, blank or null values.\n\nItem codes are unique and no duplicate codes are available.\n\nAn item code is associated only to one category.\n\nCharacter count of item codes do not exceed 50 (Else, contact the Platform API Team to extend the character limit)\n\nNote:\n\nIf an item-code has prefix '0' or long digit value, example: 9988777665511, 00006785, it is recommended not to open the file directly on Notepad.\n\nYou can use only predefined attributes or custom attributes configured in InTouch > Settings > Miscellaneous > Inventory Operations > Inventory Attributes. Any unknown attribute will be ignored automatically. Make sure to configure your required attributes on the Inventory Attributes page before importing\n\nInventory hierarchy Each organization might have a different product hierarchy - it could be hierarchy levels, supported attributes, brands or any other attribute. Before starting with the import, you need to validate the data file of the organization with that of the Capillary's.\n\nThis profile is used to import the inventory details of stores. The CSV file should contain all the mandatory fields along with supported optional fields.\n\nSKU*\n\nEAN*\n\nPrice\n\nDescription\n\nBrand Code\n\nCategory Code\n\nStyle Code\n\nPrerequisites\n\nData Quality Report (DQR) to check the quality of data mapping (in percentage).\n\nCompare inventory item-codes with that of transaction line-items before importing.\n\nCSV Sample: Sku,Ean,Price,Description,BrandCode,CategoryCode,StyleCode 1234567,1234567,32,Pencils,Camelin,Camelinpencil2HB,PencilSytle\n\nConfiguring Template\n\nUpdate Inventory Line-items\n\nThis profile lets you update line-item ids (item codes) in the loyalty_bill_lineitems table. Use this profile to update item ids that are wrongly entered or with null values.\n\nLine-item id\n\nItem Code\n\nPrerequisites Compare inventory item-codes with that of transaction line-items before importing\n\nCSV Sample Line Item Id, Item Code 9970661,GB58\n\nConfiguring Template Check the Update the existing item code box to allow updating existing item codes with the new values in the csv file and click Submit.\n\nAdd Brands\n\nThis profile lets you add child brands, or update existing brands. To use this profile, the org should have configured at least with one parent brand.\n\nBrand Code\n\nBrand Parent Code\n\nBrand Name\n\nBrand Description\n\nCSV Sample: Brand Code,Parent Brand Code, Brand Name,Brand  Description Shirts,Apparels,Brand Name,Men Apparels\n\nConfiguring Template Add the fields that you want to include for the current profile template and click Submit to save the template.\n\n*Mark parent brand as root if not mapped for new brands: Check this option to make new parent brands of the current import as root brands.\n\nMark parent brand as root if not mapped for existing brands : Check this option to make existing parent brands as root brands through the current import.\n\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU. For more information, see OU support for product inventory .\n\nAdd product attributes\n\nThis profile lets you add or update product attributes. A custom / product attribute is a user-defined attribute for a product. For example, a smartphone model can have a “colour” attribute that contains information on the colours available for the smartphone model.\n\nCSV Sample: attribute_is_enum, attribute_label, attribute_type, attribute_extraction_rule_type, attribute_extraction_rule_data, attribute_is_soft_enum, attribute_use_in_dump\n\nConfiguring Template Add the fields that you want to include for the current profile template and click Submit to save the template.\n\nSelect the attributes and click add\n\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU.

There can be erroneous scenarios where brands want to deduct some points from customers.\n\nFor example : A transaction was done and the brand imported the points with the bill_id. Now when a customer returns the bill via a credit card of let's say HDFC, HDFC doesn’t know what was the original bill. And hence there is no way to link the original and the return bill. In such cases, HDFC would want to create a new PA entry with all points as returned. This will be similar to negative PA entry but only the return value will be -ve. Thus overall the points will be reduced for the customer.\n\nToday in our system, points can be deducted in three ways : Redeemed, expired and returned. In this case, the points will be considered as returned.\n\nUser identifiers like mobile , userId, externalId etc,\n\nReason for manual adjustment\n\nPoints to deduct\n\nOptional fields can be program_id, promotion_id, promotion_external_identifier and points awarded_id\n\nRefer here for more details - Technical document\n\nNote\n\nCapillary does not support converting already allocated redeemable points to non-redeemable points. If you need to remove or suppress redeemable points after allocation (for example, due to double allocation or error), you can use the Manual Points Adjustment UI / API .\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago"}

It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import. Example:\n\nConsider Blue Purple(org) loyalty program is having 12 months of points validity for a list of customers which they want to change to 24 months. In such case, you can select the extended expiry type and use the relative point expiry option to update the point expiry duration from 12 to 24 months.\n\nCSV Fields\n\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)* CSV Sample using User ID :\n\nUser Id\n\n1250755\n\nTemplate configuration\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nChoose customer's unique identifier\n\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.

Any points that are expiring in the specified duration will be updated as per the new expiry date you set.\n\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\n\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\n\nEarly expiry : Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date. For example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the early expiry date must be before August 30, 2021.\n\nExtended expiry : Select this option to extend the expiry date from the actual expiry date. For example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the extended expiry date must be after August 30, 2021.\n\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Note\n\nEnter the reason for updating the point expiry date.\n\nSet expiry date to\n\nChoose the expiry date from the following options.\n\nFixed date expiry : Set a date on which you want to expire the points.

It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\n\nExample :\n\nConsider there are five customers in an org with different reasons to update their point expiry and you want to update customer 1, customer 2, and rest customers(customer 3, 4, and 5) with different expiry type(extended or early expiry) and date(fixed, relative, or immediate).\n\nUse case 1 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference ID Consider customer 1 has accidentally received points with a incorrect validly (incorrect validity awarded - 4 months, correct validity should be - 6 months). In this case, you can update customer 1 with an extended points expiry of 2 months(relative) using point awarded reference ID. Note: When point awarded reference ID is mentioned then you also have to mention point awarded reference type in the csv file.\n\nUse case 2 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference type Consider customer 1 has 100 points that are going to expire on August 31, 2021 but the store will be closed from August 22, 2021 to August 31, 2021(10 days) due to store redesigning. In this case, you can update customer 2 with an extended points expiry of 10 days(relative) using point awarded reference type.\n\nUse case 3 -  Update expiry for a list of customers Consider customer 3, 4, and 5 have 100 points each that are going to expire on September 30, 2021 but the store will be closed permanently after August 31, 2021 due to business failure. In this case, you can update customer 3, 4, and 5 with an early points expiry date - August 31, 2021(fixed).\n\nThe following are fields of the csv file.\n\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)*\n\nPoint Awarded Ref Type*\n\nPoint Awarded Ref ID*\n\nExpiry Type*\n\nExpiry Unit*\n\nExpiry Value*\n\nExpiry Update Reason Type*\n\nExpiry Update Reason Note\n\nCSV Sample using User ID :\n\nUser Id,Point Awarded Ref Type,Point Awarded Ref Id,Expiry Type,Expiry Unit,New Expiry Value,Expiry Update Reason Type,Expiry Update Reason Note\n\n235233,POINTS_AWARDED,134435,relative,months,12,Extend_Expiry,Covid\n\nTemplate configuration\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nChoose customer's unique identifier\n\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.\n\nUSER_ID\n\nMOBILE\n\nEMAIL\n\nEXTERNAL_ID\n\nCARD_NUMBER\n\nChoose Program Name\n\nSelect the loyalty program for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\n\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\n\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\n\nEarly expiry : Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date.

Now the org want to remove the promotional points from all 10 customers. In such case, you can select the promotion and use the customer identifier(User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number) to change the expiry type(early expiry) and date(immediately).\n\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)*\n\nCSV Sample using User ID:\n\nUser Id\n\n1250755\n\nTemplate configuration\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nChoose customer's unique identifier\n\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.\n\nUSER_ID\n\nMOBILE\n\nEMAIL\n\nEXTERNAL_ID\n\nCARD_NUMBER\n\nProgram Name\n\nSelect the loyalty program for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\n\nSelect Promotion\n\nSelect the promotion for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\n\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\n\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\n\nEarly expiry : Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure_event_notification", "title": "Event notification", "text": "Event notification\n\nEvent Notifications is a framework that provides near real-time data of events generated in the Capillary System and helps brands subscribe to notifications about particular events.\n\nOverview\n\nEvent Notification allows building integrations with Capillary events that originate either through Capillary API (such as customerAdded and transactionAdded)requests or Capillary products such as Loyalty+ (such as pointsIssued and pointsRedeemed), Engage+ or other. Once an event notification is configured, brands can build custom solutions to trigger for pre-configured actions.\nEvent Notifications are sent through Webhooks configured in Capillary Event Notifications. The following is the top-level diagram, of the Events Notification framework (ENS).\n\nUse Cases\n\nThere are several use cases of event notifications. A couple of examples are provided in the following.\n\nEnable PII-less Communication\n\nIn some cases, brands prefer not to send customers' personally identifiable information (PII data) such as names, email ID, and mobile number to Capillary and manage communication completely at their end. Event Notification can be used to get the events that require communication such as customer registration, transaction, points issual, points redemption, points transfer, etc. On receiving these events, clients can send communication to customers with their names and identifiers as needed.\n\nIntegration with 3rd Party Applications\n\nEvent notification can be used to build integrations with 3rd party applications. For example, send a survey link to a customer post transaction event from a survey application such as Medallia; sync customer’s loyalty information to an e-commerce platform such as Magento. Integration can be built to receive real-time events, enrich information using Capillary APIs (if required), and sync it to the 3rd party application using the brand's APIs.\n\nSteps involved in ENS set up\n\nThe following are the steps involved in the set up of the Event Notification Service (ENS) for a client.\n\nWebhook creation\n\nWebhooks let you create an integration URL that is required to post events data from ENS to Webhook. Before starting with the configuration process, you need to create a Webhook account and generate a URL. The URL is further used to post events generated by the client (This can be done by creating an API proxy for API Gateway such as Apigee).\n\nEvent Notification Configuration\n\nOnce you have the Webhook URL, you need to subscribe to the events that need to be notified. This can be done either through UI or API. For more details, see Add Event Notification\n\nEvent Consumption\n\nOnce the setup is completed, the client can consume and process events data and use the data to configure actions to trigger. For more details see, Consuming event notification\n\nAt present notification the following event notifcations can be configured:\n\nrewardIssued : Notification that a reward has been issued to a

To make sure that the event notifications are delivered to the Webhook’s configured URL, Capillary analyses these failures and executes the retries accordingly.\n\nThe failures are classified into two categories:\n\nNon-Retriable\n\nRetriable.\n\nNon-retriable failures\n\nNon-Retriable failures include issues such as 400 Bad Request errors , which are unrecoverable, regardless of the number of retry attempts made. As a result, these events are permanently marked as failures and are not subject to further retry.\n\nRetriable failures\n\nRetriable failures, such as 429 Too Many Request errors , are not specific to individual events but rather are based on the overall load or traffic of requests being sent to the system.\n\nWhen there are retrievable failures, the system uses a retry mechanism instead of continuously checking for new events. This mechanism involves resending the same event that encountered the failure for processing. This approach gives the system a chance to recover from Retriable failures caused by high request loads without overloading it with repeated requests\n\nThe retry strategy used includes exponential backoff. Exponential backoff is a delay strategy where the system waits for extended periods before attempting to resend the event. This helps prevent overwhelming the system with repeated requests.\n\nThis retry strategy continues for at least 7 days. During this time, the system keeps attempting to process the failed event. If it still cannot process, after this duration, it moves on to the next event in the processing queue.\n\nYou can access detailed event information, including its current status, statistics, and detailed error messages in the event of a failure, through the event's log API endpoint, using the unique requestId associated with that particular event. For more information, refer to the documentation Tracking Request .\n\nIdempotency Check\n\nA timed-out event is an event that is received by the server, but a successful response is not sent back to Capillary. The event is again sent to the Webhook URL. Hence, Hence, the integration backend or server should be able to handle the same event multiple times.\n\nA duplicate event can be identified by the “eventId” parameter in the event payload:\n\nIf there is a duplicate eventId, the event should be ignored.\n\nData Enrichment\n\nEvent payload contains short and optimal information. It does not contain complete information about its entities. For example, a transaction event contains identifiers and basic transaction information but does not contain other information such as custom fields, extended fields, or line item level information. To get complete information about an entity, you need to use the respective APIs.\n\nRefer to Event Payload to view the list of events and fields that are sent in the event notification.\n\nChange Data Capture\n\nUpdate events such as customerUpdated, and transactionUpdated only notify that some update has occurred in the associated entities, but not contain information about the change in the entities. To identify the exact change, the integration service needs to call the respective APIs.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

But there is no event notification for such instances. To understand with an example:\n\nStep 1: Milestone on lifetime purchases created, and milestone value is 10,000.\nStep 2: Customer made a transaction worth 3000.\nStep 3: Customer’s milestone achieved value increased from 0 → 3000\nStep 4: Brand will get an event notification about the above step.\nStep 5: After days, the customer returned the purchase of step-2.\nStep 6: Now the milestone achieved value will decrease from 3000 → 0.\nStep 7: But brands/customers are not getting any event notification of the same.\n\nNow, with this latest enhancement, brands will get notified even in the case of return transactions about the decreased milestone value.\n\nIf the “Name” key is “ReturnBill”, it’s a return transaction where milestone value is decreased by the “currentEventTargetValue” (400 here).

Along with these, filters are created or updated; resulting in continually improved fraud detection algorithms and an enhanced knowledge base.\n\nFraud Detection Methodologies\n\nThe Engineering team creates a fraud template using the methodologies provided herein. You can create an export template for the fraud customer to download fraud customer details.\n\nFraud Detection Methodologies\n\nVintage and Visit\n\nVintage is the number of days since the first transaction date, and Visit is the number of times the customer has come to the store. The KPI for this rule is (Vintage) / (Visit) which must be less than a predefined threshold value to get the fraud status.\n\nTransaction hours count in a day\n\nThe customers will be prone to have fraud status if he crosses a predefined number of transactions in a day (transactions count here is the distinct transaction hours in a day).\n\nTransaction Amount Limit\n\nThe system will trigger out transactions having amount more than the predefined threshold, and that particular customer will be tagged as 'Fraud'.\n\nTop Customer Percentile\n\nThe rank of a customer is sorted in descending order of lifetime purchase. Customers that have 0.1 percentile would have a higher probability of making fraud by entering other's transactions into their account.\n\nTransactions in different zones on the same day\n\nTransaction Happening in 2 different regions/zones on the same day or with a gap of 6 hours, i.e., customers having transactions more than 1 in a day in different zones are prone to be tagged as a fraud. There would be very few customers with purchases in 2 different regions on the same day.\n\nVisits and Latency\n\nFor Visits, refer to rule number 1.\n\nThe Latency has been defined as (last bill date – joined date)/ (visits – 1). The chances of a customer being a fraud are high if his visits are more than the predefined value and have a lower latency of visit than the predefined value.\n\nSpike in Transaction Amounts\n\nIf any transactions amount is more than ten times the average transaction amount, there is a high possibility that the particular customer is doing fraud.\n\nTransaction per Day\n\nThe maximum number of transactions in a day should be less than a predefined critical value.\n\nTransaction per Week\n\nThe maximum number of transactions in a week should be less than a predefined critical value.\n\nLatency of Redemption\n\nThe Latency of redemption has been defined as (max date of redemption – min date of redemption) / (# unique days where points got redeemed– 1).\n\nIf the number of redeemed visits is more than a predefined value and the latency of redemption is less than a predefined value; then there are high chances of fraud.\n\nNumber of times points are redeemed\n\nThe number of times the customer has redeemed points should be more than the predefined value to mark fraud.\n\nRedemption Rate\n\nThe ratio of points redeemed visit days to points awarded visit days should be more than a predefined value to mark a particular customer fraud.\n\nTotal Points Redeemed\n\nIf the total points redeemed by the customer is more than a critical value, he is more prone to fraud.\n\nFraud Handling Process\n\nDetection is based on heuristics defined in Fraud detection rules.\n\nEach rule will be given weight from 0 -1. This weight will affect the importance of the rule in the total scoring.\n\nOnly those customers having a total score >= a predefined critical value are marked as fraud.\n\nIn most cases, the total score is around 1.5.\n\nCustomers have tagged fraud who violates at least two rules.\n\nThe system can reassign each customer to one of the following statuses - MARKED, CONFIRMED, RECONFIRMED, NOT FRAUD, INTERNAL. Customers marked as CONFIRMED, RECONFIRMED, or INTERNAL will have some restrictions.\n\nReflections of Fraud Users\n\nExclude their information from all the reports.\n\nDo not issue vouchers.\n\nDo not allow mobile number change from those customers.\n\nNot able to redeem points.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/new-request-flow-introduction", "title": "Introduction", "text": "Introduction\n\nRequest-workflow specific terms\n\nWorkflow: A workflow is a defined sequence of steps or tasks that are carried out to complete a particular process. For example, tasks carried out to complete the customer identification change process. Standard workflow: A standard request workflow is a workflow that is readily available to all brands by default and is created by the Capillary product/tech team as a generic workflow that can cater to the requirements of most brands.\n\nCustom workflow: A tailored workflow designed specifically for a brand when the standard workflow does not meet its unique requirements. This custom workflow is developed with the assistance of the Capillary Solutions team to address the brand's specific needs.\n\nAction: An action refers to any operation or task performed by an Admin user to a Customer’s profile or on the Capillary platform. For example, tasks such as changing customer status, redeeming points, issuing goodwill points, earning badges, or other critical operations.\n\nMarker: A maker is a user role responsible for initiating and submitting a request or action. The maker creates and submits tasks such as changing customer status, redeeming points, or issuing goodwill points.\n\nChecker: A checker is a user role responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting requests or actions initiated by the maker. The checker ensures that the submitted tasks, such as changing customer status, redeeming points, or issuing goodwill points, meet the necessary criteria.\n\nOverview\n\nA brand can have different business operations, and depending on the nature of their business and loyalty program setup, you may need to restrict certain admin user actions on the Capillary platform. A typical way of gate-keeping user actions is maker-checker-based workflow - wherein certain Admin users with “maker” permissions can raise a request & others with “Checker” permissions are tasked with evaluating the requests & approving or rejecting them.\n\nAs of now, the Capillary platform supports Maker-checker workflows on Membercare for the following workflows:\n\nIdentifier Change - Mobile, Email, External ID\n\nGoodwill points\n\nGoodwill coupons\n\nPII Deletion\n\nAccount Merge\n\nRetro-transaction claims\n\nWith the new request workflow framework; brands can now incorporate different request workflows (maker-checker-based workflows) on the platform.\n\nAt present, the following requests are supported using the new request framework:\n\nEarn badge\n\nPoints redeem\n\nCustomer status change\n\nGoodwill points\n\nRetro-transaction claims\n\nIssue Badge\n\nThe new request workflow framework offers ready-to-use standard workflow to cater to the needs of the majority of the requirements of the brand.\n\nIn case, the standard workflows don’t meet a brand’s requirements; you can contact the Capillary solutions team to create custom workflows tailored to meet your needs. A custom workflow supports complex use cases in a workflow such as multiple approval workflows and validation-based workflows. Extension-based validations can also be configured as a part of a workflow.\n\nThe audit logging of the requests can be performed using the request workflow APIs. A request ID is created for every request, allowing you to retrieve the associated details using this ID.\n\nNotes\n\nAt present, there are two request workflows for Goodwill points & Retro-transaction claims.  In the future releases, all the existing Orgs from the older workflows will be migrated to the newer workflow.\n\nReporting on the new requests is still not available on Insights and will be available in te future releases.\n\nYou can configure the request workflows at Member Care > Settings > Request workflows .\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/new-request-workflow-faq", "title": "FAQ", "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat is the difference between a standard workflow and a custom workflow in the context of Capillary's platform?\n\nStandard Workflow: A standard workflow is a predefined series of tasks that all brands have by default. The Capillary product/tech team developed it to fulfil the common criteria of most brands.\n\nCustom Workflow: A customized workflow is a set of tasks created exclusively for a brand. When the standard workflow fails to fulfil a brand's specific requirements, the Capillary Solutions team creates a custom workflow to address those needs\n\nHow do I decide whether to use a standard workflow or opt for a custom workflow? Select a standard process if your brand's needs are similar to those met by the platform's established workflows. These ready-to-use workflows are intended to serve the majority of companies and can efficiently manage typical processes without the need for further customization. Opt a Custom Workflow if your brand has unique requirements not covered by typical processes, consider creating a custom workflow. Custom workflows are best suited for complex use cases that require numerous approval phases, validation-based processes, or extension-based validation. In such circumstances, you can contact the Capillary Solutions team to create a custom procedure that meets your specific requirements.\n\nCan you provide examples of scenarios where a custom workflow would be more beneficial than a standard one? Implementation and Integration. Scenario: Your brand has distinct operational requirements or business regulations not met by standard workflows. For example, in multiple-approval workflows, auto-approval is set for a certain points range; another range requires approval by a senior resource, and for a certain range, a senior manager’s approval is required. Implementation & Integration: By collaborating with the Capillary Solutions team, you can create custom workflows         tailored to your brand's unique requirements, ensuring that all processes are optimized and aligned with your business goals.\n\nWhat parameters can be customized within a standard workflow to fit our brand’s specific needs? Request auto-approval: If your brand wants specific requests to be authorized automatically, this option can be modified accordingly. Goodwill point limit: You can choose a maximum number of Goodwill points that can be requested.\n\nCan we prepare a report of the submitted requests on Insights? Reporting on the new requests is still not available on Insights and will be available in the future releases.\n\nHow can I access audit logs for requests processed through the new workflow framework? The audit logging of the requests can be performed using the request workflow APIs. A request ID is created for every request, allowing you to retrieve the associated details using this ID.\n\nHow will existing organizations using older workflows for Goodwill points and retro-transaction claims transition to the new request framework? Transitioning existing organizations using older workflows for goodwill points and retro-transaction claims to the new request framework is planned for future releases. This migration will ensure that all organizations benefit from the enhanced features and capabilities of the new workflow system.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/features-of-loyalty", "title": "Features of loyalty+", "text": "Features of loyalty+\n\nLoyalty+ has a very easy-to-use UI and a powerful rule engine that has the flexibility to create rules based on various parameters such as loyalty type, promotions, customer spending. It provides the flexibility to create context-based loyalty programs, for example,\n\nBasic Loyalty Programs let customers enroll in the loyalty program and get incentivized with points or coupons for every transaction they make.\n\nPaid enrollment programs are also called membership-based loyalty programs which allow customers to buy loyalty status (tier) to enjoy the tier benefits.\n\nLoyalty+ provides you the flexibility to set up tier upgrade and downgrade conditions based on the customers' frequency of visits. You can also have tier upgrade based on purchases made by group members, customer tagging to customize the loyalty program to suit the brand’s needs.\n\nYou can configure conditions to downgrade their tier when they do not make any transaction for a certain period. For example, assume that a loyalty customer makes frequent purchases in the first month and achieves a higher level tier and during the second month, the frequency of visits is low, you can downgrade the tier based on the recent transaction period.\n\nThere are a number of different types of loyalty programs that can be configured using Loyalty+ and you can incentivize your customers in multiple ways, in the form of points, coupons, promotions, etc.\n\nMoving the non-loyalty customers to loyalty customers can be done through various Loyalty+ drives. For example, Loyalty+ supports issuing coupons to non-loyalty customers on an event. This ultimately increases engagement and strengthens the Loyalty Base.\n\nLoyalty+ can be used to incentivize customers based on the payment mode used for a transaction. Loyalty+ supports incentivizing for different card types such as payments through Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Visa, and Mastercard. It also allows incentivizing bonus points based on banks. For example, award 10x points when a customer transacts with an HDFC card.\n\nLoyalty+ supports Omni-channel loyalty, i.e., you can configure actions for the selected sources/accounts. The points are earned and burned seamlessly in online/offline platforms. Customers can be notified about the loyalty updates through a number of channels including SMS, email, Mobile Push and WeChat. All cross-channel registrations of a customer have been combined automatically and associated with a single account.\n\nOrganizations with multiple brands can configure a different loyalty program for each brand while maintaining a single customer profile across the organization using the Multiple Loyalty Programs (MLP) feature in Loyalty+. This feature can also be used to create multi-country loyalty programs.\n\nThe communication channels supported in the loyalty workflows are SMS, Email and Push notifications.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/types-of-loyalty-programs-we-support", "title": "Types of Loyalty Programs we support", "text": "Types of Loyalty Programs we support\n\nEarning Based Programs : Customers can unlock rewards and incentives that they have earned through their purchases/visits, meaning their overall engagement with the brand, in the form of points. Industries that have a vast number of customers who make small purchases in every transaction would prefer these kinds of programs to convert more and more customers into regular shoppers by offering them incentives, whose value is derived from their engagement directly.\n\nTier Based Programs : These programs help customers earn additional benefits as they move up over other less engaged/loyal customers. Since getting into a higher tier is based on purchases/visits, the more loyal the customer is, the higher their tier is and the better their benefits are. These programs work for every industry, but would have significant impact on industries where a quality experience is the need since the purchases can be of high value and not very frequent.\n\nGamified Loyalty Programs : These programs bring out the competitiveness and interest in customers that a plain loyalty program might not. These can be posed as challenges which the customers can pass to earn stamps or badges, which may or may not have monetary value, but always do have a status attached to them, so the customers can have a feeling of exclusivity. These programs also help in community building and hence, organic marketing and growth. Gamification adds a fun element to the customer experience which can tend to be plain otherwise, hence not generating enough attention or interest from customers.\n\nCoalition Based Loyalty Program : These programs are made to combine incentives from two or more brands to customers in a single transaction. This helps the brands as this can lead to increased revenues for all parties involved and also help split the burden of the incentive costs among them. These programs include the ones based on tender modes, for example when customers get an additional discount when a particular card is used to pay for the products purchased from a retailer.\n\nRewards Based Loyalty Program : These programs are designed to reward customers in the form of benefits/incentives out of the custom designed rewards catalog instead of straight discounts and can help generate interest from customers.\n\nReferral Based Loyalty Program : These programs are designed to increase revenues for the brand through word of mouth referrals while creating extra benefits for customers for their referrals. If the product and loyalty program are up to the mark, these programs can create a lot of organic reach which results in a lower Cost of Customer Acquisition.\n\nConglomerate Loyalty : These programs aid the large corporations that would want to set up multiple loyalty programs for all the organizations under their umbrella to better cater to the respective customers of these organizations as keeping all organizations with one particular kind of program might not suit the strategies adopted by them according to their industries.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

During data import of promotional points, you can customize the awarded date. In the case of importing transaction points, the awarded date cannot be modified.\n\nThe number of days in which points for a transaction actually get credited to the customer's current points. The points for a transaction are initially credited to the customer’s account as promised points. After the prescribed number of days, the points get credited to the current points after the delayed accrual period (configured by the org). For example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected as promised points in the customer's account right after the purchase. These points are actually credited to the current account after seven days. However, if the customer returns the shirt (in the return period), the promised points will be reverted and current points will not be updated.\n\nReducing the current tier of a customer to a lower tier is called tier downgrade. Brands can opt for tier downgrade on the basis of visit count and transactions. For example, downgrade the tier of a customer if no transaction is made in the last 6 months.\n\nPoints that got expired because the customer did not use them within the validity period are called expired points.\n\nThe date on which awarded points get expired is known as the expiry date. The expiry date for particular points is always calculated with respect to the corresponding awarded date. It is derived by adding the expiry strategy to the awarded date.\n\nThe measure by which the points awarded to customers expire is called an expiry strategy. All points awarded to customers will get expired (if not used) as per the expiry strategy configured for these particular points. There are multiple expiry strategies for a loyalty program. The default strategy is used for BillPointsAllocation action/AllocatePoints action. If none of the above-mentioned actions are configured in the point’s engine then it will consider the first expiry strategy that is configured.\n\nThe total number of points earned by a loyalty customer to date. Lifetime points are the sum of current points (active points), expired points, and redeemed points for a given customer.\n\nA transaction can have one or more products in it. Each different product in a transaction is considered a line item.\n\nActive points in the customer’s loyalty account are called loyalty or current points. Customers are allowed to redeem their loyalty points based on the brands' redemption criteria.\n\nBonus points that are awarded to the customer irrespective of any transaction are called promotional points. These points are either awarded by the actual promotional campaigns or through import while balancing the customer’s lifetime points.\n\nLoyalty points that are used by customers are termed redeemed points.\n\nTiers are loyalty privileges that are awarded to loyalty customers. A brand can have one or more tiers. Tiers are required to be used by all organizations. If no tier is configured, one default tier is created by default.\n\nPoints that are awarded against a transaction made by the customer are called transaction points. If transaction-level points are added or modified through import then transaction or transaction line-item profile has to be chosen.\n\nMoving the customer to a higher tier is called tier upgrade. Brands can opt for tier upgrades on the basis of visit count and transactions. For example, upgrade the tier of a customer if 50 transactions are made in the last 100 days.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/faqs", "title": "FAQs", "text": "FAQs\n\nLoyalty Programs (Single & Multi-Loyalty)\n\nIf I have two loyalty programs running simultaneously, how I do know which one is active for stores and which one is being used for point allocation? Every org will have a default program (org level). When you have multi-loyalty programs configured for the org, points are issued from the program mapped to the TILL.\n\nHowever, this depends on the configuration. For example, if a customer is enrolled in all the programs then the logic will run for all the programs but if the customer is only in one program then he will be evaluated for the rules written in that program and the points will be given for that program only. When it comes to an MLP kind of structure than one customer could be part of multiple programs or just one program and each program can have a different allocation strategy so all this is evaluated when the ‘add transaction’ call comes to us and whatever they are mapped to allocation happens as per that. In the case of MLP, there are 2 programs that are always evaluated one is the default program for that ORG, and the other is where they are enrolled.\n\nCan I use a single loyalty program for multiple stores? Yes, you can achieve this by applying scope to your rule in workflows.\n\nIs there a concept of equivalent tiers in loyalty programs? How is a single card which is used for different events mapped to the program? Is there a need/ solution for it in the loyalty program?\n\nTiers\n\nWhat is the difference between tier expiry and tier downgrade? Tier expiry is when you have set a date for expiry and the user is automatically downgraded when the expiration date comes up. But when you are downgraded, you can basically set certain configurations, and depending on those configurations, the user will be downgraded.\n\nWhat happens to the status of my customer if he/she does not fulfill any of the tier eligibility criteria? By default, the customer will be in the base tier of the program.\n\nDoes each of the renewal conditions have to be met or any one of them is enough? As of now, it's an 'or' condition, so either of those conditions will result in a renewal.\n\nWill changing eligibility force the tiers to compute the settings for all users in advanced settings? Yes, it depends on the tier evaluation cycle.\n\nCan I set an action in the workflows to send a communication to the customer after I retain the customer tier based on conditions such as at least 10 visits or 1000 points, even if the customer has not met the tier criteria? Yes, that action can be set in the workflows.\n\nIs it possible to upgrade tiers by using any other means apart from the usual upgrade conditions like a coupon or passing the points rule? As of now, you can do this manually through member care.\n\nWhen I configure 26K points to upgrade a tier (say Gold), will it consider 26,000 points or 26,001 to qualify? When configuring a tier, you will only see upgrade rules greater than or equal to (>=). Hence, a customer with 26000 points or more will be in the Gold tier.\n\nPoints\n\nCan I limit the number of times my customer can earn points? You can limit the number of points a customer can earn in the points earning condition. However, there is no option to limit the number of times the points are issued for a customer.\n\nWhat is the use of proportion and max point allocation? Use Proportion lets you issue points based on the line item amount. The Maximum points allocation is to set a threshold value for the number of points a customer can earn.\n\nHow is the Transaction Points Allocation action different from Allocate Points? Transactional Points - Points you earn as per the configured ruleset for making a transaction.\n\nAllocate Points - Points you can assign on the transaction amount and custom field values based on the configured ruleset.\n\nTrackers\n\nWhat tracking method should I apply to the use case in the tracker?\n\n\"Reward a customer on their 10th visit\" You could either use Cyclic Windows or Calendar-based Cyclic Window. However, it is recommended to use Cyclic Window in this case.\n\nIn a moving window tracking method, if the duration is 365 days and the tracking entity is a customer transaction, will it include the data of the current day also? It will include the current date's data. For example, assume you are tracking customer transactions with a moving window tracking method with a duration of 365 days. If a customer does a transaction on Nov 24, 2021, then the tracking window will be from Nov 23, 2020, to Nov 24, 2021 (including the dates mentioned).\n\nCan I use tracker for actions other than Tier Upgrade? You can use trackers for Tier eligibility, tier renewals, customer milestones, incentivization, and other custom activities.\n\nIf a tier is upgraded using tracker value, does dynamic point earning work? Yes, dynamic points earning will work for tier upgrades based on tracker value.\n\nWhat type of incentives are supported for tracker conditions? You can award points and offers to customers on tracker aggregate.\n\nCan you share an example of a tracker which is used to issue coupons based on line-item purchases? In cases where the brand doesn't want to credit the B2B customer every item they purchase (say cigarette/alcohol).\nFor example, In the case of Metro, if you don't want to incentivize customers on the purchase of cigarettes/alcohol. You can exclude such line item prices from the tracker.\n\nWill the Transaction Return be considered as a visit in a tracker? No, Transaction Return will not be considered as a visit in any case.\n\nIs the Scope applied to the ruleset level or the entire workflow level? The scope you apply in Workflow will apply to that particular page (activity).\n\nReturn transactions\n\nWhat happens when no reference to original bill is passed or the reference bill no. passed in not found?\n\nThe return bill is submitted without storing any reference to the original bill.\n\nHow returns would be handled if there are two bill numbers with same purchase date?\n\nError is raised if multiple references are found. But, this is questionable, because the same return bill can be submitted if no reference to original bill is passed.\n\nWhat if the line items passed in the return bill do not match with the original bill? It depends on the type of return - line item, full or amount.\nDepends on normal or mixed return.\n\nIf type is line item, the line item will be matched with the line items in the original bill for amount, quantity, code, etc. If any of them do not match, error would be raised. If normal return and type is amount, the amount at transaction level will be compared with the amount of original bill. It will also be checked whether any earlier return happened, and if there is any balance left for return.\nIf mixed return and type is amount, the amount mentioned in the line item will be compared with the amount in the original bill.\n\nIf type is full, all the line items would be returned.\n\nWhat if there are multiple line items with type amount for a mixed transaction?\n\nFor a mixed return transaction,\n\nFirst line item with return type amount would be considered a return transaction and would be compared with amount of original bill.\n\nFirst line item with return type amount would be considered a return transaction and would be compared with amount of original bill.\n\nSecond line item with type amount would be considered another return transaction. The amount would be compared with the balance amount (original amount - first return amount).\n\nSecond line item with type amount would be considered another return transaction. The amount would be compared with the balance amount (original amount - first return amount).\n\nIs it possible to return NI transaction without original bill reference?\n\nYes, it is possible. In this case, line level data will not be saved since no validation is possible. Only the amount will be returned.\n\nPoints only for the net amount (not on delivery fees, taxes, etc..)\n\nIs there a functionality to set across the board for all transactions not to include delivery fee and tax value to be included as points?\n\nAnswer :\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/retro-guide", "title": "Retro guide", "text": "Retro guide\n\nThis page provides you with information on transactions that are applied/added to a loyalty program after the transaction has taken place.\n\nRetroactive transactions, also known as retro transactions, refer to transactions that are applied/added to a loyalty program after the transaction has taken place.\n\nThis is a common scenario in many domains and can occur for a variety of reasons:\n\nAn error in the transaction process\n\nA delay in the transaction being recorded\n\nThe customer has not provided the loyalty details at the time of the transaction\n\nAir lines example:\n\nGenerally in airlines, sometimes customer won’t provide their loyalty details at the time of the transaction. So basically that becomes a non-loyalty transaction, and because of that, no loyalty benefits will be given to that customer.\n\nHowever, the same customer will call customer service sometime in the future, and request to convert that non-loyalty transaction in the past to a loyalty transaction. Upon validating a few details, generally, most airlines will agree to that. This is a case of a retro transaction.\n\nPrimary requisite to use retro functionality:\n\nWhenever a brand wants to utilize this retro transaction functionality, they have to raise a ticket with the sustenance team to configure a setting from the backend.\n\nScenarios of retro processing:\n\nThere are primarily two ways in which the retro processing will happen:\n\nWorkflow rules-based retro processing (point in time program and promotion configurations)\n\nTier-based retro processing (point in time tier of the customer)\n\nWorkflow rules-based retro processing:\n\nLet’s understand with the help of a real-case scenario. There is a customer who made a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction on 20th May 2023.\n\nHowever, the same customer called the customer service on 17th August 2023 requesting to convert that ‘non-loyalty’ transaction to a ‘loyalty transaction’.\n\nIn this case, had the brand already enabled ‘retro-transaction’, then the processing of that transaction should happen according to the workflow rules set on 20th May 2023.\n\nNow imagine this scenario:\n\nOn 20th May 2023, say the rules present in the workflow are ‘XYZ’.\n\nOn 10th August 2023, say the brand has changed those rules to ‘ABC’.\n\nNow, even though the processing should happen according to the rules presented on 20th May 2023, as the brand changed them on 10th August, our system doesn’t know what rules to compute the transaction. To avoid this, always create new set whenever you are replacing the rules in your workflows.\n\nIt could be as follows:\n\nHere, there is a brand that is using retro functionality, and they are changing their workflow rules on the 1st of July. So instead of replacing them in the same set, they created another set as follows:\n\nSet 2: Jan 1st, 2023 to June 30th, 2023 Action: Allocation of 98 points\n\nSet 3: July 1st, 2023 to August 31st 2023 Action: Allocation of 89 points\n\nNow, when the processing of the ‘non-loyalty’ transaction happens based on the original date of 20th May 2023, our system has information on what rules to be computed.\n\nAs a result, even though processing happened on 17th August, the customer will get “98 points” as per the configs present during the 20th May 2023.\n\n“So whenever as a brand, you want to use retro functionality, make sure you are not replacing the existing rules, but rather creating a new set with the appropriate date as the scope”.\n\nImportant callout The KPIs or trackers will always be evaluated as per the processing time of the event and not the bill date of the event. For eg. a sales tracker might have a value of 1000 as per the original bill date but in case of retro the current value will be taken for evaluation which might be more or less than 1000\n\nTier-based retro processing:\n\nSimilar to the above case, let’s say this time, the action is not simple points allocation, but rather some kind of setting depending on the tier of the customer.\n\nGold tier: 20% of the transaction amount\n\nSilver tier: 15% of the transaction amount\n\nBronze tier: 10% of the transaction amount\n\nNow, let’s say a customer made a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction on 20th May. At this time, the customer is present on “Silver-tier” but won’t get any benefits because that is a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction.\n\nThe same customer called the customer-care on 17th August requesting to change that transaction to a ‘loyalty’ transaction by providing the relevant details.\n\nMeanwhile, let’s say the following tier activity happened to the customer’s tier:\n\nSo now, when the customer requested on 17th August to convert his non-loyalty transaction (which happened on 20th May 2023) to a loyalty transaction, here is what happens:\n\nOur computation will check on which tier the customer is present on the original transaction.\n\nAs the customer is present on “Silver tier” as per the original transaction date, computation will happen according to that.\n\nSo the customer will get 15% points based on the amount of that transaction.\n\nAPI details:\n\nSearching for an older transaction: Here\n\nTo request a retro approval: Here\n\nTo approve the above request: Here\n\nUpdated 3 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points-rolling-expiry", "title": "Points Rolling Expiry", "text": "Points Rolling Expiry\n\nPoints rolling expiry is a feature that resets or extends the expiry date of loyalty points when a customer performs certain actions, such as making a transaction or redeeming points. These actions are referred to as \"rolling events.\" Points rolling expiry allows you to control when loyalty points expire, ensuring that points remain valid as long as the customer continues to engage in rolling events.\n\nWhen a rolling event occurs, the expiry date for all points earned is updated or rolled to a later date. The \"rolling window\" determines how far this expiry date is extended. For example, a rolling window of 12 months will extend the expiry date of the earned points by 12 months.\n\nCreating a Points Rolling Expiry\n\nTo configure the points rolling expiry for a loyalty program, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Loyalty+ home page, navigate to the Settings page by clicking the  icon\n\nOn the Loyalty+ home page, navigate to the Settings page by clicking the  icon\n\nSelect Points Rolling Expiry from the menu.\n\nSelect Points Rolling Expiry from the menu.\n\nEnable points rolling expiry for all programs using the Points rolling expiry across program toggle.\n\nEnable points rolling expiry for all programs using the Points rolling expiry across program toggle.\n\nSelect the rolling expiry strategy using the Points rolling expiry strategy dropdown.\n\nSelect the rolling expiry strategy using the Points rolling expiry strategy dropdown.\n\nThe rolling expiry strategies are as follows:\n\nRolling Expiry Strategy\n\nDescription\n\nExample\n\nMaximum expiry date\n\nAll points earned by the customer are assigned a single expiry date.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-a-multi-loyalty-program", "title": "Multi-Loyalty Programs", "text": "Multi-Loyalty Programs\n\nOverview\n\nLarge enterprises that are global in nature have complex structures. For example, they\nmay have multiple brands, franchisees, or other partners who have different outlets. They may also have brands spanning multiple countries and want a program that supports all of these different spectrums.\n\nAs companies move towards giving customers a global experience they may want a situation where a customer signed up in Country A, they can go to Country B and say they are a member and then redeem the points they earned in Country A. This would mean that a member of the topmost tier would receive all of the perks, no matter which country the member traveled to and that is a very attractive incentive that can be provided to customers.\n\nNote\n\nAn org cannot have one program for a zone and another for a concept.\n\nIn MLPs, you have a single customer database for different programs across different industries, countries, etc.\n\nUse Cases\n\nConglomerate businesses that have multiple brands ranging from, say, apparel to pharma and healthcare. All of these kinds of businesses may be experiencing very common programs like cash back or gift vouchers and other programs like that and multiple different brands across industries can come together and form a single program where customers can earn in one program. Also, using MLPs, these brands can have their own tier and earn conditions.\n\nGlobal companies can run cross-border loyalty program each with their own local flavors\n\nBrands can cater to different customer segments and needs by having multiple types of memberships\n\nFor programs created through multiple partnerships that are integral parts of the program\n\nBasic concepts of Multi-loyalty Programs.\n\nAn org will have a Default Loyalty Program (org level program) that is created while setting up the org on InTouch.\n\nThe Default Loyalty Program is applicable to all zones/concepts and the individual loyalty program is applicable to the zone/concept/card series. So a zone or concept can have two loyalty programs - one is the program created for that particular zone/concept and the other is the default program.\n\nBased on the Till from which an event is triggered, the system identifies the respective zone/concept and initiates the loyalty program associated with it.\n\nIf an event such as a transaction or registration is triggered, the system first identifies the loyalty program associated with the Till and executes the rules and actions associated with the program.\n\nIf two programs are identified, then the system executes both programs.\n\nStrategies or configurations of a loyalty program will be applicable only for that program.\n\nLimitations of MLP\n\nFor an org, you can create programs either on concepts or zones but not both.\n\nA zone, concept, or card series can have only one loyalty program (excluding the default program).\n\nA store or Till cannot have multiple loyalty programs (excluding the default loyalty program).\n\nProduct category/brand-based loyalty program configurations are not available.\n\nPoints or coupons are redeemed from one program at a time.\n\nMultiple currencies are not supported across loyalty programs.\n\nAn org can either have zone-based, concept-based, or card-series-based loyalty programs. You cannot have one with concept-based (OU) and another with card-based.\n\nTransaction Behavior\n\nNew Transaction - Once a transaction is made, the corresponding programs are identified, and accordingly \"new transactions\" rules will execute.\n\nTransaction Update - Any transaction update event will only pass through the corresponding program that is configured for the till from which the update event is initiated. In case the transaction add and transaction update tills are different then rules will run for the program where the transaction has originated.\n\nTransaction Return - For the Transaction return event, the rules are executed from the program where the purchase was made, not where the return is made. For example, if a customer transacts at till 1(Program 1) but returns products at till 3 (Program 2), in this case, the return rules are executed from Program 1, not from Program 2.\n\nTypes of multi-loyalty program\n\nOU-based Loyalty\n\nEach loyalty program needs to be configured in the system and there should be a defined boundary between each program. For example, if a conglomerate wants to run different brands, say Trends , Jewel , and Foodworld , working across zones East , West , and South . In this case, conglomerates can either run loyalty programs at a brand level (concept) or zone level.\n\nAlso, if an org runs in different countries, you can run a separate loyalty program for each country. The following are the different functionalities supported for an org that runs in different countries. For details, see here.\n\nSeparate earning rules and tiers across countries.\n\nSeparate redemption rules across countries.\n\nSeparate points-to-currency ratio.\n\nSeparate earning and redemption rules for independent programs.\n\nAdditionally, One umbrella group program for a group of countries.\n\nEarn points in the umbrella group program on purchases in any of the countries.\n\nSeparate earning rules and tiers across countries.\n\nSingle points balance for the end customer.\n\nA common set of redemption rules across countries.\n\nSingle points-to-currency ratio.\n\nOther types of loyalty programs that brands can achieve through MLP.\n\nMulti-Currency and Multi-Country Programs\n\nCard-based Loyalty\n\nA group company issues multiple loyalty cards of that org and a customer could have one or more loyalty cards that they can use across countries. The loyalty benefits such as points balance, earning rules, redemption rules, tiers, etc - are associated with a loyalty card (and not a country). For details, see card series overview , create card series , generate a card number and issue a card to a customer .\n\nGetting Started\n\nAll orgs start off with a single Loyalty Program - this is and becomes the \"Default\" program for the org.\nOnce you ascertain the need for an MLP and it has been subscribed - raise a request via JIRA to enable MLP specifying the type of MLP needed (Note: The type can't be changed later on)\nYou can then start creating more programs and mapping different card series, concepts or zones to the new programs\n\nYou can't change the mapping once set so take care to set this up properly\n\nOne program can have multiple zones, concepts or card series mapped to it, but one zone/concept or card series can only be mapped to a single program\n\nThis graph shows the KPI trend for the whole org, not individual org units.\n\nCreate Zone/Concept/Card series based Loyalty Program\n\nBefore creating a new program for the org, you need to create a ticket to the support team or PM team requesting your preferred categorization - on what basis do you want loyalty programs to be created for your org. You can have zone, concept, or card series.\n\nTo create a loyalty program for an Org Unit, follow these steps.\n\nLog on to InTouch .\n\nIn the menu, click Loyalty+ .\n\nClick Create Program to create a new program.\n\nOn the Create Program page , enter the program details. Refer to the table for field descriptions\n\nClick Save . A blank loyalty program is created without any configurations.\n\nIf the program is inactive, select the program and click Save on the activation prompt that appears.\n\nOnce the program is enabled, click on the program to open and click Edit program .\n\nNote\n\nTo modify details of a loyalty program, click Edit program . While configuring ensure that there is no overlap between the two loyalty programs. To inactivate a loyalty program, open the program > Click on the Edit icon > Disable Activate Program > Click Save .\n\nWhile configuring ensure that there is no overlap between the two loyalty programs.\n\nTo inactivate a loyalty program, open the program > Click on the Edit icon > Disable Activate Program > Click Save .\n\nCustomer activities : For any activity such as transaction and customer update, first, the relevant programs will be identified and then the configured rules and actions will be executed for that particular program.\n\nNote\n\nThe default program will always be executed. However, if the event also matches with any other non-default program, that will also be executed.\n\nGet Details (API) : Whenever any information such as Current points, tier, and the bulk call is required, either the calling module will pass the corresponding program or the system will identify the corresponding program from the configuration and pass the relevant value to the caller.\n\nIn the listing page, hover over a loyalty program name to view its program identifier.\n\nIn the listing page, hover over a loyalty program name to view its program identifier.\n\nSignificance of Default Program\n\nAll customer activities and events will necessarily be \"evaluated\" by the default program, so the default program acts as sort of the global or umbrella program for MLP setups\n\nActions and configs wrt to umbrella program type setting need to be configured inside the default program (e.g. group redemptions)\n\nAs of now, Referral and User Group based Loyalty are only supported inside the Default Program\n\nIn addition to the default program, one other program is also evaluated based on the store concept, zone or card series used. For concept, if a customer shops in a grocery chain, they would be added to that program. For zone, if a customer shops in, say, west Singapore, they wuld be added to that program. For cards, it depends on the type of card that is presented.\n\nPoints in MLP\n\nEarn Anywhere, Burn Anywhere\n\nThe points awarded from programs along with the earn conditions, and expiry conditions are all contained in sort of individual \"accounts\" as part of the program\nHowever MLP allows a feature of allowing the points to be used in a fungible manner across all the programs at the time of redemption or transfer\nStep 1: Navigate to the Default Program > Workflows\n\nStep 2: Select the currentEvent activity, and set the rule isGroupProgramRedemption to True.\n\nStep 2: Select the the \"Redeems Points\" customer activity\n\nStep 3: Add the action \"Redeem group points\"\n\n(the default redemption strategy would be decided based on the program strategy)\n\nStep 4: Repeat the same for \"Transfer Points\" activity as well using the \"Transfer group points\" action\n\nStep 5: In the API for redemption use the parameter \"group_redemption\": true  and for transfer use \"groupProgramTransfer\": true  in the request body\n\nNote: The system automatically chooses the earliest expiring points across all programs to redeem or transfer and in case of transfers the points are transferred to the default program of the recipient\n\nSingle Rolling Expiry\n\nThe basic option of rolling expiry works only for \"Makes a transaction\" event and works only for the points within that particular program\nWhat if you want to have points rolling together across all programs for different events - single rolling expiry helps to achieve this (this is not present inside Loyalty+ right now, you would need to go to organsation settings)\n\nStep 1: Navigate to the Organisation Settings > Miscellaneous > Points Management > Single Points Expiry\n\nStep 2: Check the option to enable Single Rolling Expiry across programs\n\nYou can define the rolling period in Days or Months - The period configured here will now override the duration configured inside the Rolling Expiry conditions\n\nYou can also select the various events that will cause points to roll across all programs\n\nNote: This setting continues to roll only the points that were awarded using some rolling expiry condition, all other points do not roll\n\nConfigure Strategies\n\nPoints Allocation Strategy : Each program has its own points allocation strategies. A point allocation strategy can be created and used within a program. The allocation strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even within the Default Program. To know how to create Points Allocation Strategies, click here .\n\nPoints Expiry strategy : Each program has its own points expiry strategy. A point expiry strategy can be created and used within a program. The expiry strategy of one point cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. To know how to create Point Expiry Strategy, click here .\n\nPoints Redemption Strategy : Each program has its own points redemption strategy and points to currency conversion ratio. The redemption strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. Points redemption strategies can be created and used within a program. To know how to create points redemption strategies, click here .\n\nWhile making redemption, the caller has to specify from which program and how much point needs to be redeemed. Whenever a redemption call is made and the program id is not passed, the points will deduct from the program/till where the redemption call is made.\n\nManage Trackers : Trackers created within a program can be used and evaluated within the program. It will work the same as in the case of a single loyalty program. Tracker of one program can not be used or evaluated in any other program, not even in the default program. To know more click here .\n\nCustomer Registration : Customer once registered in any program by default will register across brands in the org but the enrollment will be done only for the program where the till belongs to.  Enrollment in other brands will not happen till the customer makes a transaction in that program.\n\nCustomer updates : Customer update events will pass through all the programs which as associated with the till from where the event is fired. So if the Org wants to allocate points to the brand loyalty program or Default program, then they have to write rules on the brand loyalty program and Default program as well.\n\nManage Tiers : Tiers for each program can be created within the program and they work within the program only. Click here to know more.\n\nConfiguring Rules/Sets\n\nRule and set configuration need to be configured at the program level depending on the requirement. The rules configured for lifetime purchases, current points, and no. of transactions, are always in the context of the program.\n\nFor example, let's assume a customer has made 6 transactions across the organization in different tills/stores.\n\nIf one writes a rule within program 1 on currentcustomer.lifetimepurchase , it will be evaluated on 1200, and on program 2, it will be evaluated on 900. Moreover, each program will have over customer KPIs such as Lifetime purchase, current points, lifetime points, trackers Visit count, and the number of transactions. Click here to know more.\n\nView Loyalty Details on Member Care\n\nYou can see program-wise (including Default Program) details of a customer with program-level KPIs in Member care and Binary.\n\nHandling MLP Integrations\n\nCustomer Enrollments\nCDP Registration and Program enrollment are distinct events and customers will have to be individually enrolled in each program\n\nFor Card series, an additional integration option will be to use the https://{host}/v2/customers/{userId}/changeIdentifier API to add a new card from that card series to the customer to enrol them to that program\n\nNote: Enrolling customers across multiple brands, countries and programs will be subject to local state, country and global laws on privacy and consent - please ensure they are adhered to at the time of integration\n\nPosting transactions and events\n\nTransactions and other events posted via APIs are always evaluated by the default program and resolved & evaluated by any 1 other non-default program based on the till_id or store code associated with the authorisation used - this is in case of zone or concept based MLP\n\nNote: In case invalid or non-existent till code is passed while using oAuth then system would assume the admin till and process the event only within the default program\n\nIn case of card series based MLPs, during integration it has to be ensured that the card number is used as the identifier across all available events - this causes the right program to be chosen for evaluation based on the card series.\n\nNote: In case the card number is not passed, then the event will only be evaluated by the default program\n\nFetching MLP details\n\nMost Fetch APIs by default will only provide the loyalty details of the default program for the customer when fetching\nWatch for explicit parameters in the request to fetch details across all programs or other programs\nThe exact param would be different across different APIs - so please refer to the documentation for each API\nMost APIs will also commonly support program_id as a query parameter to pass the program ID and get the specific details for that particular program\nFetching details across multiple programs in a single request can result in bulky responses that can be slow and increase network costs, instead try to use one program at a time as needed and use light APIs whenever available (e.g. points expiry schedule, tier details, etc.)\n\nFAQs\n\nCan a TILL have two loyalty programs?\n\nNo. For an org, a loyalty program can be created either for a zone or concept but not both. For example, an org cannot have one loyalty program for a zone and another for a concept.\n\nWhat is the default loyalty program?\n\nIt is the base loyalty program of the org which is created by default, all zones/concepts of an org are part of the default program as shown in the illustration. Default programs work as a normal program with its own slab, strategies, and rules.\n\nNote\n\nAll programs of an org, either default or brand specific one, runs independently and are not related or dependent on other programs.\n\nCan points earned in one program be burned in another program?\n\nYes.\n\nCan points earned in one country be burned in another country for the same org?\n\nIt completely depends on the implementation.\n\nCan we change the default loyalty program?\n\nNo. Default loyalty program is created at the org level once the Loyalty module is enabled for that org. Every brand (concept/zone) can have only one loyalty program (except the default program). You can create slabs, points strategies, and rules for each program just like a normal loyalty program\n\nCan multiple programs run on a same till?\n\nNo\n\nWhat if a store that is mapped to a zone changes through import?\n\nProgram will work as per new zone loyalty configuration and you can fetch customer details program wise. However, the loyalty details such as points earned, points burned are still associated to the previous program.\n\nWill there be any change in  Sharingan for MLP?\n\nNo changes are required for the existing functionalities. However, if MLP is required, then integration needs to be changed accordingly.\n\nWill there be any change in e-com for MLP?\n\nNo changes are required in the existing functionalities. However, if MLP is required, then integration needs to be changed accordingly.\n\nHow to use APIs in case of cross-brand redemption?\n\nYou have to pass the program id from which the redemption is required, if program id is not passed then it will try to redeem from the till's program.\n\nIf no program id is passed while redeeming points, from which program the points will be deducted?\n\nPoints are deducted from the non-default loyalty program which the current TILL is mapped to. However, if the till is not mapped to any loyalty program, points will be deducted from the default program.\n\nWhat should I do when I get an error group redemption action executed for non group redemption payload ?\nMake sure that you have set the following:\n\nMake sure that the config ENABLE_GROUP_PROGRAM_REDEMPTION is enabled. Enabling/disabling the Config takes about 24 hours to be reflected.\n\nMake sure that the parameter group_redemption is set to true.\n\nMake sure that the loyalty workflow rule currentEvent.isGroupProgramRedemption is set to true.\nGroup redemption event configured under loyalty workflow and enabled the group redemption option and also enabled the \"allow skipping validation\" under redemption setting for marvel api to work….Is there any other configs..\nAccording to the system, for group program redemption scenario to be handled properly, there has to be a rule called \"currentEvent.isGroupProgramRedemption\" set properly in the condition, and depending on whether it is true or false, the appropriate redeem points action should be set for it, as can be seen here from the screenshot.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/group-loyalty", "title": "User Group Loyalty", "text": "User Group Loyalty\n\nA user group comprises individuals in a hierarchical order who belong to a particular organisation. An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An organisation can designate different roles to these members and incentivise them according to the organisation’s preference. User group loyalty allows an organisation to incentivise not only its customers but also other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which help an organisation to establish brand loyalty.\n\nIn user group loyalty, an individual’s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.\n\nFor example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction. This way of incentivising the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact with an organisation.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThe following are some of the key concepts of user group loyalty\n\nIn B2B Loyalty, an org is identified as an entity.\n\nAn individual can be part of multiple groups.\n\nYou can configure the total number of groups that a member can be part of.\n\nThe parent control or the admin role can be transferred from one member to another.\n\nPermissions to manage group benefits.\n\nA member of a group can still make individual transactions.\n\nAll the members in a group can pool in their transactions for a tier upgrade.\n\nPoints return and downgrade checks are supported in case of transaction return.\n\nBoth the group and the individual can be incentivized when they transact while representing the group.\n\nUse Cases\n\nFollowing are the different scenarios where user group loyalty is applicable:\n\nB2B Loyalty\n\nImportant Terminologies\n\nCompany : Any business entity which is enrolled in the brand’s B2B loyalty program.\n\nSub-company : A smaller business entity associated with a Company. For example, a big company like Tata can be registered as a company while Tata Motors, TCS can be registered as sub-companies.\n\nCustomer Role : Role is used to capture the association between customer and company. A company can have customers in various roles. For example, a company enrolled in a fleet loyalty program of a brand can have customers in various roles like a driver, associate, owner, etc.\n\nCustomer Hierarchy : Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. To know how to create and configure a hierarchy\n\nNote\n\nFriends and family usergroups are now deprecated.\n\nHow a User Group works\n\nA user group includes a primary member and multiple secondary members. The concept of incentivizing and tier rewarding at the group level is called Group Loyalty, In group loyalty, when a secondary member makes a transaction, you can issue points to both secondary and the primary member.\n\nTier upgrade is on the basis of cumulative purchases of group members (if the upgrade strategy for the program is on lifetime purchases). Hence, the tier of all the group members remain the same (as per the primary member). When a secondary member leaves the group, his/her tiers downgrades to the lowest tier.\n\nThe common tier is achieved through the syncing of the secondary member's tier with the primary member's. Tier syncs either upgrade or downgrade when a secondary member makes a transaction or joins the group. The sync includes both upgrade and downgrade.\n\nCreating a User Group\n\nCreating a user group involves two steps -\n\nAdding a group with the primary member.\n\nAdding a group with the primary member.\n\nAdding group members (secondary members).\n\nAdding group members (secondary members).\n\nFor details of each user group API, see the User Groups of the V2 API Documentation.\n\nYou can create user groups through API POST /usergroups. Using identifiers of the primary member, there are two approaches of creating a user group.\n\nUser ID of the primary member (which is generated internally when registering).\n\nWith InTouch credentials of the primary member.\n\nAdd each secondary member to the group using the API POST /{groupId}/members/{userId}, either with user Id or identifiers.\n\nConfigure the loyalty program. There are new events introduced for Group Loyalty - Group Transaction Add, Group Transaction Update, and Group Return Transaction. You can create rules for these events as required.\n\nPoints pooling from secondary members to the primary member\n\nLoyalty+ allows transferring of points earned for an event by a secondary member to the primary member automatically for each event.\n\nCommunicating group points to the primary member\n\nOn the Workflow, select the customer activity PointsContributionToGroup and set the action Points Contribution to Group.\n\nYou can see options to configure messages for the primary member and secondary member.\n\nConfigure the message for primary and secondary members separately and click Save.\n\nCurrently, you can use communication to notify the primary member that points are credited to his loyalty account for an activity done by a secondary member of the group. Similarly, you can also notify the secondary member that points are transferred to the primary member. Points pooling tags are still in the development phase.\n\nClick Reconfigure save the changes in the live program.\n\nTo see the points contribution or points pooling of secondary members, use v2/usergroups/pointContributionHistory. For more details, see V2 API Documentation.\n\nGroup transaction (Add, Update, and Return)\n\nThere are new events introduced for Group Loyalty - Group Transaction Add, Group Transaction Update, and Group Return Transaction.\n\nActions supported for Group Loyalty\n\nAll the loyalty actions (such as points allocation, coupon issual, communication) for group events is for the primary member and the respective secondary member.\n\nFor example, points could be allocated for a new transaction (transaction/add) to the member who made the transaction, and also allocate points to the primary member for the Group Transaction/Add event.\n\nPoints import for the primary member\n\nSupport for  importing Bill Promotion points and Line Item Promotion points for the primary member of a group\n\nby enabling the Import on group primary customer option during import.\n\nIn Import profiles, Bill Promotion Points and Line Item Promotion Points, for a group, customer refers to the primary member of the group, and original customer refers to the secondary member who made the transaction.\n\nTier syncing of secondary members and primary members\n\nWhen a secondary member joins a group, the tier of the secondary members is upgraded or downgraded to that of the primary member's. The following sections provide how the tier of secondary members is effected in different scenarios.\n\nWhen a secondary member joins/leaves the group\n\nWhen a secondary member joins a group, his/her tier is upgraded or downgraded as per the tier of the primary member. When a secondary member leaves a group, his/her tier is downgraded to the lowest tier of the program.\n\nHowever, if the secondary member is qualified for tier upgrade due to individual KPIs,  the tier is upgraded on the first transaction after leaving the group. The individual KPIs refer to the member’s current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases as per the tier upgrade strategy. The individual KPI values include the activities of the member within the group and outside the group.\n\nFor example, assume a member has made three transactions as mentioned in the following. The member’s lifetime purchase = B1 + B2 + B3 and member’s lifetime points = P1 + P2 + P3.\n\n▪ Bill 1 (before the member joined the group) – Points allocated: P1\n\n▪ Bill 2 (when the member was in the group as a secondary member) – Points allocated: P2\n\n▪ Bill 3 (after the member left the group) – Points allocated: P3\n\nTier upgrade on transactions of group members\n\nWhen a secondary member makes a transaction, the group transaction is evaluated first. If the program uses lifetime purchases as the upgrade strategy, and the primary member is eligible for the upgrade, firstly, the primary member is upgraded and then the secondary member who made the transaction will also be upgraded.\n\nThe tier upgrade for both the primary member and the secondary member who made the transaction happen in the same event flow. The tier of the other members of the group will not upgrade in the same event flow.\n\nHowever, if another secondary member makes a transaction, his/her tier is upgraded with the tier of the primary member.  In this, the secondary member is first upgraded to the new tier, and then the transaction/add event is evaluated.\n\nThis states that the tier upgrade of the secondary member will always be in Eager mode irrespective of the tier upgrade strategy type (Eager, Dynamic or Lazy). Only the tier of the primary member upgrades according to the tier upgrade strategy type.\n\nFor example ◦ A group has 4 members – P1 (Primary), S1, S2, and S3 (Secondary)\n\nT = T1, S1 makes a purchase\n\n▪ On the purchase, P1 gets eligible for the tier upgrade.\n\n▪ P1 gets upgraded first and then\n\n▪ S1 gets upgraded.\n\nT = T2, S2 makes a purchase\n\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n\n▪ S2 gets upgraded\n\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\n\nT = T3, S3 makes a purchase\n\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n\n▪ S3 gets upgraded\n\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\n\nTier upgrade of a secondary member on purchases made of the primary member\n\nScenario: The tier of the primary member upgrades due to a transaction made or an import.\n\nIn both cases, the tier of each secondary member is upgraded only when the member makes a transaction (after the tier upgrade of the primary member) in Eager mode. That is, the tier of the secondary member is first upgraded and then the transaction/add event is evaluated.\n\nFor example: A group has 4 members – P1 (Primary), S1, S2, and S3 (Secondary)\n\nT = T1, P1 makes a purchase\n\n▪ On the purchase, P1 gets applicable for upgrade\n\n▪ P1 gets upgraded\n\nT = T2, S1 makes a purchase\n\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n\n▪ S2 gets upgraded ▪ Event rule gets evaluated\n\nT = T3, S3 makes a purchase\n\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n\n▪ S3 gets upgraded\n\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\n\nTier Downgrade of secondary members\n\nThe tier of secondary members is downgraded only when the tier of the primary member downgrades.\n\nIf the downgrade See the Primary Member Downgrade on Purchase or Visits section for the primary member downgrade if downgrade strategy is based on Purchase or Visits  Primary Member Downgrade on Earned Points section covers primary member downgrade if downgrade strategy is based on Earned Points\n\nTier upgrade of the primary member on lifetime purchases\n\nIf the tier upgrade  (in tier upgrade strategy) is set based on Lifetime Purchases, then for the primary member it is the sum of lifetime purchase of the primary member and purchases done by the secondary member while they are in the group.\n\nLifetime Purchases of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade = (Lifetime purchase of the primary member) + (Purchases of the secondary member while they are in the group).\n\nBelow are additional details on ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\n\nThe calculation is applicable only for the upgrade strategy on lifetime purchases\n\nTrackers for the primary member is purchase and visits of the primary member only; purchases or visits of secondary members are not considered\n\nHowever, rule expressions and tags consider the Lifetime Purchases of the primary member as the purchases of that particular member only and do not include the purchases of secondary members (while they are in the group)\n\nGroup Lifetime Purchases on Member Care and API is not the same as ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\n\nThe transactions of secondary members before joining the group or after leaving the group are not included in the 'Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\n\nLifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade includes transactions of a secondary member when the member was in the group. So even if the secondary member leaves the group, his/her transactions when in the group is included in ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’.\n\nFor example: Primary (P1) and Secondary (S1 and S2)\n\nT=T0, P1 member does a purchase of Bill 1 T=T1, S1 member does a purchase of Bill 2 (outside the group)\nT=T2, P1 member forms the group\nT=T3, P1 member does a purchase of Bill 3\nT=T4, S1 joins the group\nT=T5, S2 member makes a purchase of Bill 4 (outside the group)\nT=T6, S2 joins the group\nT=T7, S1 makes a purchase of Bill 5 (within the group)\nT=T8, S1 leaves the group\nT=T9, S2 makes a purchase of Bill 6 (within the group)\nAt T= T9, ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’ =\n\n(Lifetime purchase of primary member i.e. Bill 1 + Bill 3) + (Purchases of secondary members while they are/were in the group i.e. Bill 5 + Bill 6).\n\nTier upgrade of primary member based on Points and Trackers\n\nIf the tier is on current points, lifetime points, or tracker values, these values is corresponding to primary member only and do not consider the points/tracker of secondary members.\n\nFor example: A group has 3 members – P1 (Primary), S1 and S2 (Secondary)\n\nP1 – Current Points: 500, Lifetime Points: 1,000\n\nS1 – Current Points: 800, Lifetime Points: 2,000\n\nS2 – Current Points: 2,000, Lifetime Points: 3,000\n\nThe upgrade strategy is on lifetime points with Tier 1 to Tier 2 threshold as 2,000 points. so, none of the members will get upgraded as the lifetime points of the primary member is only 1,000.\n\nTier Downgrade of the primary member\n\nIf the loyalty program uses purchases in the downgrade strategy, the downgrade calculation for the primary member is (purchases of the primary member) + (purchases done by the secondary member while they are in the group) for the tier duration.\n\nFor brands using loyalty on user groups, It is recommended to have Purchase or Visits as one of the downgrade criteria so that cumulate purchases by all members get evaluated.\n\nFor example: Downgrade criteria is set to 12 months from the last slab change date\n\nThe primary member gets upgraded to a tier on January 07, 2018.\n\nOn January 31, 2019, while evaluating for downgrade, ‘Purchase’ value for the primary member is (Purchases done by the primary member during Jan 07th, 2018 – Jan 31, 2019) + (Purchases done by secondary members during Jan 07, 2018, – Jan 31, 2019, while they were in the group).\n\nDowngrade on points earned\n\nIf a loyalty program uses ‘Earned Points’ in downgrade strategy, these values is corresponding to the primary member only. These values will not include points earned by secondary members.\n\nFor example: a group has 3 members – P1 (Primary), S1 and S2 (Secondary)\n\nTier duration – Jan 07, 2018 – Jan 31, 2019\n\nDowngrade Criteria – Downgrade if ‘Earned Points’ < 1,000 P1 – points earned during tier duration: 500 S1 – points earned during tier duration: 1,100 S2 – points earned during tier duration: 2,000\n\nP1 – points earned during tier duration: 500\n\nS1 – points earned during tier duration: 1,100\n\nS2 – points earned during tier duration: 2,000\n\nIn this case, all the members get downgraded because the primary member doesn’t satisfy the downgrade criteria.\n\nTwo additional profiles are present in the system for User Group Loyalty: currentgroupprimary and currentusergroup\n\nExpire Points for Group / Fleet Users\n\nA fleet user is a member of a fleet loyalty program . To enable point expiration for fleet users, enable the FLEET_GROUP_LOYALTY_ENABLED configuration flag and configure the FLEET_ENTITY_TYPE parameter. Once enabled, points earned by individual users in a fleet will expire based on the expiration conditions.\n\nTo enable this for an organisation, raise a JIRA ticket to the sustenance team.\n\nUpdated 25 days ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/behavioral-loyalty", "title": "Behavioral Loyalty", "text": "Behavioral Loyalty\n\nBehavioral Loyalty refers to the incentives offered to the customers on the basis of their behaviors, and not on the transactions, as is the case with all other types of loyalty programs described in the modules. These can include activities like registering, updating profiles, etc.\n\nIn the system, Behavioral Events need to be set up by going to the organisation settings.\n\nOn this page, you will find all the Behavioral Events already set up in the org in question.\n\nYou can create a new event by picking from the library of events that Capillary provides or you can create your own new event as well. If you pick from the library, the event will come with the attribute part of the event already set up.\n\nBut if you want to create your new event, you need to select the attribute from the options available.\n\nIf the input coming is a free input coming from the source, you can choose \"Enum\", \"Date\", \"String\" or \"Double\" as data type. If the input maps to an existing attribute that Capillary would have in the system, the data type can be taken as \"Product Category\", \"Product SKU\", \"Coupon Code\", etc.\n\nOther configurations also have to be added to the attribute as required. And you can also check the \"Required\" checkbox to make it a mandatory attribute.\n\nIn \"Add Destination\", you have to check the Loyalty box (right now Behavioral Events can only be added in Loyalty).\n\nWhen you create an event, you can see it with a \"Testing Pending\" signal, to publish which, the API in question needs to called and reached successfully. Once the event is published, it will be available for use.\n\nOnce this is done, you then have to configure the behavioral events in Loyalty. Head to the program in question. As of now, behavioral events are only present in Promotions.\n\nIn the activity selector, you can search for Behavioral Events. Only the events that are published show up here.\n\nYou will select the required event and select the program.\n\nFor Behavioral Events, in Promotion Workflows, in the Points Allocation action, all other parts work similar to Transactional Events but Prorate On works differently. It will only give integer values that need to be selected from the drop down.\n\nIn the Expression Editor, you can see a host of different options to write the rule based on different attributes in the event itself.\n\nBehavioural event support for UserGroup2\n\nAs of now, the behavioural events didn’t work for user groups. The behavioural events would only work for individual customers. Now, behavioural events can be configured for user groups as well.\n\nThis is possible at the action level. When configuring an action like Points allocation, issue coupons, etc. you will be able to see a drop down to select “individual” or” User group”. On selecting the user group option, that particular action in the behavioural events will work for the groups in your system.\n\nBelow screenshot helps in understanding:\n\nAbility to connect behavioral event to a specific card series\n\nOnce behavioral events are configured, whenever a customer exhibits that behavior, they will be triggered and the customer will get the benefits.\n\nUntil now, while configuring behavioral events, brands don’t have the ability to create them with respect to card series as an identifier. This became a problem for organizations that are using card series based loyalty programs.\n\nFrom now, those brands will be able to create behavioral events with respect to card series too. How that works is, while creating the BE, card number will present as an option for identifier type. Using this, even card series based organizations can provide benefits and rewards to their customers based on the card series.\n\nBehavioral attributes as tags in the communication\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning, while creating behavioral events brands can configure \"attributes\" depending on their use case. Those attributes help the brands in further finetuning the behavioral activity.\n\nSome of the most used attributes are Customer ID, Till code, Date, Product SKU, etc. When the behavioral event is triggered for a customer, the configured attributes will get the corresponding data.\n\nThe best part is, that these \"attributes\" can be used as \"tags\" in the creatives/communication flow of the Loyalty+. As of now, we are supporting \"attributes\" as \"tags\" in the following places only:\n\nSend SMS\n\nSend Email\n\nSend mobile notification\n\nIn loyalty promotions, when the customer activity is selected as one of the behavioral events of the org, then all the eligible \"attributes\" associated with that particular behavioral event will be available in the above creatives. These attributes will be available as \"tags\" under the \"Generic Events\" of the \"Add Label\" section.\n\nFor example, the following is a loyalty promotion of the behavioral event (aka AddedToWishlist).\n\nNow, you can see that there is a section called \"Generic Events\" in the creatives (Send SMS in this case). Now, all the eligible \"attributes\" of this BE are available as \"tags\" in the dropdown.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

This may be available at a later date and we will notify you when that happens.\n\nYou can find all details about setting up Referral Campaigns in the article mentioned above. Also, you can use the Expression Editor to use cases like adding limitations to how many transactions from referees can lead to the referrer getting points or how many referees need to start transactions for the referees to get points.\n\nThe Expression Editor for Referral related actions has two options for rules: Referee Registration Count (refereeRegCount) and Referee Transactions Count (refereeTxnCount). These two rules behave a bit differently. The former gives the number of people that the referrer has given their code to while the latter gives the number of transactions for a particular referee. Accordingly, you can use them to set up your use case.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

Loyalty+ supports syncing tiers of partner programs and adding customers to the program. This means that two or more brands can collaborate to give incentives to customers. Here the burden of the incentive cost is divided between the brands and the customer can become loyal to all these brands simultaneously. For example, a car manufacturer and an insurance company can come together to incentivise customers to pick them together.\n\nSome of the salient features of the coalition program are:\n\nBrand partnerships to increase customer touchpoints to improve engagement and recall\n\nEnrollment only via linking APIs\n\nCan sync with partner tiers based on enrollment or update triggers\n\nDoes not expire unless a customer is delinked or unsubscribed from the partner's loyalty program\n\nNo program expiry, generally these contracts are long-term.\n\nAdd a coalition program\n\nTo add a subscription program\n\nFrom the home page, click on the desired program.\n\nClick Edit program .\n\nIn the Coalition Program tab, click Add coalition program .\n\nIn the Name field, enter the program's name without blank spaces.\n\nIn the Description box, enter a brief description of the program.\n\nClick Next .\n\nAdd benefits.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/milestones-new-flow", "title": "Milestones (also known as Target loyalty)", "text": "Milestones (also known as Target loyalty)\n\nThis page provides you with information on Milestones, including details on what they are, how to configure them, where to configure them, and how to connect a loyalty promotion to a milestone.\n\nThe Milestones feature enables brands to set targets for their customers and reward them upon achieving the defined target. A pure gamification mechanism to increase user retention.\n\nNote\n\nBenefits (aka rewards) needs to be configured seperately (in loyalty promotions) and cannot be configured along with the Milestone.\n\nIn a Milestone, the target value represents the specific objective or goal that users are required to achieve. This capability empowers brands to gamify their customers' user journey, aiding in user retention, enhancing regular sales, promoting cross-selling, and fostering enriched customer interactions.\n\nWith the help of Milestones, tracking can be done on almost any aspect of the user. The following examples help in understanding what variant type of tracking can be done using milestones:\n\nTransactional type of milestones:\n\nThe user must achieve 10,000 gross sales in a month to receive 100 points.\n\nThe user has to make 5 transactions in a week to get a premium customer badge.\n\nThe user has to purchase 5L of petrol of a specific type in a month to get a $5 coupon.\n\nBehavioral type of milestones:\n\nThe user must update their profile picture 3 times within a quarter to receive a $10 coupon.\n\nThe user has to walk 5000 steps in a week to get the fitness-freak badge.\n\nThe user has to give 3 product reviews in a quarter to get 10k points & exteem user badge.\n\nExtended fields type of milestones:\n\nThe user has to purchase $100k as a tax in a year to get the ultra-rich-high-value user badge, which gives exclusive access to company events, and sessions for free.\n\nThe user has to purchase 13 grams of gold from a specific store in 6 months to get 15k points.\n\nOther customer activities type of milestones:\n\nThe user has to redeem the points 5 times in a quarter to get a $2 coupon.\n\nThe user will be marked with the \"fraud\" label whenever a user does 10 returns in a quarter.\n\nThe user has to refer 7 new users in a year to get the elite badge and 5k points.\n\nUnified targets examples:\n\nWith the help of these, you'll not only be able to track any property of the customer using targets but also will be able to track multiple targets together which has many use cases.\n\nRefer to this to learn more about the unified targets.\n\nIn all the above examples, each user is assigned a specific \"target\" to achieve to receive corresponding benefits. This process mirrors the structure of a game, where teams or players must meet predefined targets or goals to achieve rewards and others. Thus, milestones help in implementing gamification for your brand.\n\nAccessing the Milestone configuration page\n\nTo configure a milestone, use the following direct links to access the Milestones product page:\n\nMethod 1: Clicking on the below appropriate links\n\nEU cluster: click on this link to open the EU cluster.\n\nIndia cluster: click on this link to open the India cluster.\n\nAPAC2/SG cluster: click on this link to open the APAC2/SG cluster.\n\nUSA cluster: click on this link to open the USA cluster.\n\nNote: On the homepage, make sure to change the \"org\" to your org.\n\nMethod 2: Search from org settings\n\nLogin into the homepage of the org where you want to create your milestones\n\nOn the top-right corner, click on the \"profile\" symbol.\n\nClick on the \"Organization settings\"\n\nSearch for \"milestones\", and that's it. You'll be taken to the home page of milestones.\n\nHome page\n\nAfter clicking on any of the above URLs depending on your cluster, you'll see the home of Milestones. On the homepage, from the drop-down at the top-left, select your organization to view existing Milestones and configure new Milestones for your organization.\n\nThe homepage displays a list of all the Milestones already configured for the brand. You can use the search option to search for a Milestone and can also filter the Milestone list  based on:\n\nThe name of the milestone\n\nSingle targets or multiple targets (aka unified targets)\n\nDual status of the milestone Timeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended Activity-based: Active, Inactive\n\nTimeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended\n\nActivity-based: Active, Inactive\n\nDuration of the milestone (between the start date X - and end date Y)\n\nKPI on which the milestone is created (Net sales, Gross sales, Quantity, Transactions, etc..)\n\nThis landing page also provides the following abilities for the user to perform:\n\nActivate/Deactivate a milestone Once a milestone is deactivated, it will have the \"inactive\" chip & no longer the milestone can track the customers as per its configurations. A deactivated milestone can be re-activated again as long as the milestone is not yet over.\n\nActivate/Deactivate a milestone\n\nOnce a milestone is deactivated, it will have the \"inactive\" chip & no longer the milestone can track the customers as per its configurations.\n\nOnce a milestone is deactivated, it will have the \"inactive\" chip & no longer the milestone can track the customers as per its configurations.\n\nA deactivated milestone can be re-activated again as long as the milestone is not yet over.\n\nA deactivated milestone can be re-activated again as long as the milestone is not yet over.\n\nEdit flow of the milestone Once a milestone is created, some aspects of the milestone (rules, scope, target value, etc...)can be edited but not all the items are editable. Click on the pencil icon to enter the edit flow.\n\nEdit flow of the milestone\n\nOnce a milestone is created, some aspects of the milestone (rules, scope, target value, etc...)can be edited but not all the items are editable. Click on the pencil icon to enter the edit flow.\n\nCreating a milestone\n\nYou can build the milestone from the beginning (build from scratch) or use existing templates.\n\nBuild from scratch\n\nThis option can be used if you cannot find a template that suits your requirements. To build a milestone from the beginning, perform the following:\n\nOn the homepage, click New milestone .\n\nSelect Build from scratch and click Next .\n\nEnter the following details: Milestone details Milestone cycle details Customer enrolment/audience details Target details\n\nMilestone details\n\nMilestone cycle details\n\nCustomer enrolment/audience details\n\nTarget details\n\nClick Done .\n\nMilestone details\n\nEnter the following details:\n\nName: Name for the Milestone. Always, try to provide a suitable name depending on your use case. This helps later in easily recognizing your milestone. Remember, the name of the milestone is not editable & so always think twice before providing the name for a milestone. Do not include any spaces at the beginning or end of the name.\n\nDescription: A brief description of your use case. This helps to understand the purpose of Milestone in the future, and this can be edited later.\n\nDuration: Start date & end date for the entire milestone. All the cycles of the milestone should present in this duration, and there could be a buffer between the milestone start date & 1st cycle's start date. Similarly, there could be a buffer between the milestone end date & last cycle's end date.\n\nThis will be helpful when you want your 1st cycle to start from some future date, but you want to create your milestone today itself. In that case, the milestone start date can be created today & 1st cycle's start date could be some future date. Tracking will only happen during the cycle's duration.\n\nA milestone can be created with both start & end date in the past. This helps in creating backdated milestone type of promotions as when required.\n\nFor example, assume current date is 15th May 2024. On this current date:\n\nCase 1: User could create a milestone whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 1st June 2024. In this case, start date is in the past.\n\nCase 2: User could create a milestone whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 31st march 2024. In this case, both the start & end date are in the past.\n\nPoints to remember:\n\nPast transactions/events as per the date of creation of the milestone has to be re-processes again to consider that past date in the tracking of the milestone.\n\nIn the case of 1st case, all the past data as per milestone's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 14th May 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. Transactions from 15th May 2024 to the end will be tracked automatically.\n\nIn the case of 2nd case, all the past data as per milestone's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 31st March 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. As the milestone is ending on 31st March, there is nothing that will be tracked automatically here.\n\nUser can create a past milestone upto 6 months in the past. For any use cases where higher limit is needed, reach out to product team.\n\nWhen APIs are being used to create past milestones, it may not throw the 6 months validation but be careful when using the APIs directly for compatibility issues.\n\nThis past type of milestone will work only for the \"immediate benefit rewarding\" type of milestones and won't work for the \"period end rewarding\" cases.\n\nTill code: This till code is used to attribute all the points that are being given from this milestone to a specific store. If you are a brand that doesn't have the till concept, please create a dummy till and select that here.\n\nThe target value for the customer: You can either configure it to be the same target for all the customers or a different target for each customer.\n\nSame target for all customers: Select this option to set the same target value for all the customers. This is generally the most used case.\n\nThe different targets for each customer: Select this option to assign unique target values to different customers. If selected, a CSV file containing information on target values for each customer needs to be uploaded in the subsequent steps\n\nNote: The target values are set in the subsequent steps.\n\nMilestone cycle details\n\nIn this section, enter the details of the Milestone's cycles. A cycle in the context of milestones represents a recurring period during which users are expected to achieve a specific goal.  For example, if you want your user to achieve $100 gross sales in a month, then the duration of that cycle will be a \"month\".\n\nIn the fixed period cycle, each cycle runs for a defined period from the selected start date. A maximum of 100 different cycles can be configured. You can either define the same duration for each cycle or define a different duration for each cycle.\n\nIn this, each cycle of the Milestone will have the same duration. The supported cycle durations are Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, Yearly, Weekly & Daily. Also, all these cycle durations will be in continuous nature without any gap between them.\n\nTo define the same duration for each cycle, perform the following\n\nSelect the option Same duration for each cycle\n\nFrom the drop-down, select the duration. The available options are Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Yearly, Weekly & Daily.\n\nSelect Specific date to select and start the cycle from a specific date. If you select today's date, the cycle starts immediately. This is also called a \"fixed calendar window\" The fixed calendar window works exactly as per the calendar. The day will start at 00:00:000 & end at 23:59:599. For example, if a user created a milestone of fixed calendar window type (with frequency as daily) at 11:00:000, then the 1st cycle will only have 13 hrs for the user as the day ends sharply.\n\nThe fixed calendar window works exactly as per the calendar. The day will start at 00:00:000 & end at 23:59:599. For example, if a user created a milestone of fixed calendar window type (with frequency as daily) at 11:00:000, then the 1st cycle will only have 13 hrs for the user as the day ends sharply.\n\nSelect the option After customer's 1st transaction post enrolment to start the cycle after the customer's first transaction/event within the milestone duration. This is also called a “cyclic calendar window”. The cyclic calendar window works on a \"24 hours\" basis. For the same example as above, if the user made 1st transaction at 11:00:000 (aka milestone starts), then the 1st cycle will extend exactly to 24 hours.\n\nThe cyclic calendar window works on a \"24 hours\" basis. For the same example as above, if the user made 1st transaction at 11:00:000 (aka milestone starts), then the 1st cycle will extend exactly to 24 hours.\n\nIn the Total cycles text box, define the number of cycles. The maximum number of cycles supported is 100.\n\nThis cycle type is suitable when the predefined cycle durations, such as Monthly or Quarterly, don't align with the brand's campaign strategy. Brands opt for customized cycle durations like weekly or every 10 days. This is supported only for the \"fixed window\" type of milestones, requiring users to manually provide the start and end dates for each cycle as per their use case.\n\nTo define different durations for each cycle, perform the following\n\nSelect the option Different duration for each cycle .\n\nEnter the Start date and End date .\n\nTo add more cycles, click +Add cycle .\n\nNote\n\nThis is applicable only if the target is set as \"same for all customers\" in the Milestone details (aka, the config in the previous step).\n\nTill target achievement also called a \"period agnostic cycle\" is a type of Milestone cycle where the cycle continues until the user achieves the specified target, and resets again immediately. In this configuration:\n\nThe Milestone cycle doesn't have a predefined duration. Instead, the cycle runs until the user reaches the specified target or goal. You can also define a maximum number of cycles.\n\nThe cycle starts after the customer's first transaction within the milestone duration.\n\nThere is no fixed end date for each cycle; it dynamically adjusts based on individual user achievements.\n\nThis type of Milestone cycle is particularly useful when the focus is on individual user progress toward a target rather than adhering to fixed time intervals.\n\nTo define a Till target achievement cycle, perform the following\n\nSelect Till target achievement .\n\nSelect Max limit , and in the Total Cycles text field, enter the maximum limit of cycle numbers to define the maximum number of cycles. The maximum number of cycles that you can set is 100.\n\nMilestone window mapping - fixed window, cyclic window, and period agnostic window\n\nThese are the terminologies used in the legacy Milestone workflow and this information is provided for familiarisation purposes only.\n\nFor configuring a fixed calendar window: Select the combination: (Fixed duration - On a specific date) in this new flow.\n\nFor configuring a cyclic calendar window: Select the combination: (Fixed duration - On the customer's first transaction) in this new flow.\n\nFor configuring a period agnostic window: Select the combination: (Till target achievement) in this new flow.\n\nCustomer enrolment\n\nThe customer enrolment section lets you select an audience group for the target or milestone. You can choose all registered customers, specific customers using audience groups or skip adding customers.\n\nTo apply different target values for each customer, upload a .csv file with customer identifiers, cycles, and target values, then map the fields in the UI.\n\nTo configure the audience group for a target, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Customer enrolment section on the New milestone page.\n\nGo to the Customer enrolment section on the New milestone page.\n\nSelect a customer range for the target.\n\nSelect a customer range for the target.\n\nThe details are as follows:\n\nIf you select Specific customers , choose an audience type (such as Audience group or Audience with target values) from the Add audience dropdown menu.\n\nThe details are as follows:\n\nSelecting an audience group\n\nUploading a CSV of audience with target values\n\nSelect Skip for now to skip audience selection if required. This creates a target group with no enroled customers. To enrol customers later, use the Enrol a customer to a milestone API .\n\nCustomers are now added and enroled in the milestone.\n\nThe table below explains the supported enrolment methods based on the duration and cycles selected:\n\nExample of an advanced audience enrolment:\n\nA fuel brand  wants to create three different targets. However, they want to enrol their customers into targets depending on the user's performance in some other target.\n\nTarget 1: The customer must purchase a total of 100L of petrol.\n\nTarget 2: The customer must purchase a total of 200L of petrol.\n\nTarget 3: The customer must purchase a total of 300L of petrol.\n\nThe brand wants to enrol customers in each target as follows:\n\nTarget 1: All customers\n\nTarget 1: All customers\n\nTarget 2: Only customers those who achieved Target 1.\n\nTarget 2: Only customers those who achieved Target 1.\n\nTarget 3: Only those customers who achieved Target 2. In the Audience filter (search for \" target \" in the filter search box to use filters based on targets), provide values such as the minimum target value that needs to be achieved, time factor, target name, and cycle name (optional). Based on those values, customers are automatically filtered. See below image: For more information, refer to the documentation on Audience group .\n\nTarget 3: Only those customers who achieved Target 2.\n\nIn the Audience filter (search for \" target \" in the filter search box to use filters based on targets), provide values such as the minimum target value that needs to be achieved, time factor, target name, and cycle name (optional). Based on those values, customers are automatically filtered. See below image:\n\nFor more information, refer to the documentation on Audience group .\n\nEditing customers\n\nYou can edit how customers are enroled into a target/milestone once it is active. For example, when creating the target if you have selected All customers as the enrolment method, you can change it to Specific customers .\n\nTo edit the enrolment method for a target / milestone, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the Milestone listing page and select the Edit icon for the target.\n\nNavigate to the Milestone listing page and select the Edit icon for the target.\n\nSelect Customer enrolment from the left menu to edit the customer enrolment for the milestone.\n\nSelect Customer enrolment from the left menu to edit the customer enrolment for the milestone.\n\nEdit the customer enrolment method. Refer to the section on customer enrolment for more information on the types of enrolment.\n\nEdit the customer enrolment method. Refer to the section on customer enrolment for more information on the types of enrolment.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nThe enrolment method for the milestone has been updated.\n\nNote\n\nWhen changing the enrolment method from All customers to Specific customers , customers enrolled via All customers method will remain enrolled in the milestone.\n\nTarget details\n\nA target is a set goal or objective a customer has to achieve within a certain time period to receive benefits.\n\nThe target value determines the value that a customer needs to achieve within a cycle or set end date, to receive the associated benefits. For example, if a brand sets a $100 monthly purchase goal to qualify for benefits, $100 is the target value.\n\nTo configure a target, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the target section on the New milestone page.\n\nNavigate to the target section on the New milestone page.\n\nSelect the target value behaviour for each cycle using the radio buttons under the Target value for each cycle will be? section. The options available are Same target value for each cycle and Different target value for each cycle The details are as follows:\n\nSelect the target value behaviour for each cycle using the radio buttons under the Target value for each cycle will be? section. The options available are Same target value for each cycle and Different target value for each cycle\n\nThe details are as follows:\n\nTarget value\n\nDescription\n\nSame target value for each cycle\n\nTarget value is consistent across all cycles of the milestone. For example, if the number of cycles configured is three and the target value is ₹5000, the target value of ₹5000 applies to all three cycles.\n\nDifferent target value for each cycle\n\nDifferent target values can be configured for different cycles of the milestone. For example, if the number of cycles configured is three, multiple target values can be configured for each cycle. 1st cycle: target value of ₹5000. 2nd cycle: target value of ₹10,000. 3rd cycle: target value of ₹15,000.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Different target value for each cycle target value is supported for targets that have a fixed-calendar window .\n\nThe Target section indicates the number of targets created for the target group. You can add up to 50 targets under a target group.\n\nSelect the customer activity to achieve the target using the drop down under the What should the customer do to achieve the target? section.

To fix, remove all spaces before and after a target name.\n\nIf Different activity for each target is selected as the activity type, select the customer activity from the Activity drop down\n\nConfigure the target activity KPI and target values. Refer to the section on Tracking Configurations for more information on the configurations for each type of customer activity.\n\nConfigure a sub-target for the milestone if applicable. Refer to the section on Creating a sub-target for more information on configuring a sub-target.\n\nSelect Continue to confirm the changes.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes and create a new target group with one or more targets.\n\nThe target is now created under the target group.\n\nCustomer activity refers to the various interactions a customer has with a brand. The table below lists the customer activities that can be tracked for a milestone.\n\nActivity\n\nDescription\n\nExample\n\nTransaction\n\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\n\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\n\nBehavioural event\n\nTrack customer activities like signing up, changing their profile picture, or adding items to their wish list.\n\nA customer adds items to their wish list on the app or website.\n\nEarn reward currency\n\nTrack the reward currencies ( points or alternate currencies ) that a customer has earned during a certain period. The configuration for points and alternate currencies  are the same. You can select only one reward currency per target. To track both points and alternate currencies within the same target/milestone, create a unified milestone with two or more targets and select points and/or alternate currencies as the reward currencies for each target.\n\nA brand creates the following yearly unified targets to reward loyal customers: • Earn 1,000 loyalty points • Collect 500 Stamps (brand-specific alternate currency for purchases) • Collect 100 Green Coins (alternate currencies earned by buying eco-friendly products)\n\nCustomers who meet all three targets earn the “Super Customer” badge for the year.\n\nReferrals\n\nTrack the number of times a customer has successfully referred another person.\n\nA customer refers a friend using a unique link, and the friend makes the first purchase, earning the customer rewards.\n\nPoints redemption\n\nTrack how often customers use their points to redeem rewards, provided redemption is available.\n\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\n\nCoupon redemption\n\nTrack the number of times a customer uses coupons to get discounts or benefits.\n\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\n\nReturning a transaction\n\nTrack the number of transactions a customer returns, whether a full return or part of the purchase.\n\nA customer returns a t-shirt purchased online as it did not fit properly.\n\nUpdating a transaction\n\nTrack how many times a customer changes details about their previous purchases.\n\nA customer orders 1kg bananas and 1kg mangoes but later adjusts the order, reducing the mangoes to 500gms after receiving a partial refund.\n\nUpdating customer profile\n\nTrack how often a customer updates their personal information on their profile.\n\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\n\nPromised points conversion\n\nTrack how many times promised points (temporary or pending rewards) are turned into regular points for the customer.\n\nMilestone achieved\n\nTrack how many times a customer completes a target, such as spending a specific amount or completing a behavioral event such as drinking eight litres of water. Notes: The following conditions are required to select a milestone/target to track:\n\nThe milestone/target timeline must be a fixed calendar window.\n\nThe frequency of the milestone must be lower than the milestone being created. For example, if the milestone being tracked has a frequency of daily, then the milestone being created must have a higher frequency like weekly or monthly.\n\nThe duration of the milestone must fit within the milestone being created.\n\nThe milestone must be active.\n\nThe tracking type must be default or unified. This is also supported for streaks, enabling “third-level tracking” use cases. For example: Brush twice a day, six times a week, for ten weeks in a quarter. Walk 5,000 steps a day, five times a week, for three weeks in a month Refer to the documentation for more information on third-level tracking.\n\nA customer achieves a milestone by walking 10,000 steps daily for five consecutive days, as part of a fitness challenge.\n\nPoints redemption reversal\n\nTrack how many times redeemed points are reversed to the customer due to cancellations or errors.\n\nA customer cancels a flight ticket they booked using points, and the points are returned to their account.\n\nYou can configure the target criteria and value based on selected customer activity. The types of customer activities are:\n\nTransactional activities\n\nTransactional activities\n\nBehavioral events\n\nBehavioral events\n\nEarn reward currency\n\nEarn reward currency\n\nOther customer activities\n\nOther customer activities\n\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system. When a customer makes a transaction that satisfies the conditions set by the target, the customer is rewarded. The KPIs for transactional activities are as follows:\n\nA behavioural event can be configured as a target when creating a milestone. All the behavioural events configured for the organisation will be available for selection as a target. You can configure how the behavioural event is tracked and evaluated based on certain KPIs. A behavioural event can include an attribute. The attribute of a behavioural event are specific details or entries of the event. For example, the behavioural event \"Added to Cart\" can have the attributes \"price”, \"quantity\", “SKU” etc.\n\nRefer to the documentation for more information on Behavioral Events .\n\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking behavioural events:\n\nTrack the reward currencies ( points or alternate currencies ) that a customer has earned during a certain period. For example: An airline tracks the miles (alternate currencies) earned by customers through its loyalty program. Customers can earn miles from both regular flights and special promotional events. A customer flying from India to Singapore can earn 1,000 miles for the flight, while a special promotion offering 2x miles during a holiday sale would allow the customer to earn 2,000 promotional miles. These alternate currencies earned by the customer are tracked by the target.\n\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking reward currencies:\n\nTrack the frequency of customer-level activities and events (referred to as customer-level events in the loyalty workflow) that are triggered by the user. These include: referral, points redemption, coupon redemption, return transaction, update transaction, update customer profile, promised points converted, milestone achieved, points redemption reversal.\n\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking customer-level activities:\n\nFilter Activity\n\nThis section allows you to tailor the Milestones to meet specific needs and use cases for the brand. You can define the scope and filter criteria for the Milestone, ensuring it applies to the desired customer segments and activities.\n\nScope-Based Filtering: Stores: Limit the Milestone to specific retail locations. Zones: Apply the Milestone to defined geographical areas. Concepts: Limit the milestones to specific Organizational Units (OUs). To define the Milestones for all stores, zones, and concepts, select All stores, zones, and concepts . To define the Milestones for a specific store, zone, or concept, select Specific store, zone, and concept and then choose the relevant options.\n\nScope-Based Filtering:\n\nStores: Limit the Milestone to specific retail locations.\n\nZones: Apply the Milestone to defined geographical areas.\n\nConcepts: Limit the milestones to specific Organizational Units (OUs).\n\nTo define the Milestones for all stores, zones, and concepts, select All stores, zones, and concepts .\n\nTo define the Milestones for a specific store, zone, or concept, select Specific store, zone, and concept and then choose the relevant options.\n\nRule-Based Filtering: For further refinement, you can define specific rules in the rule box. These rules can target particular line items, categories, minimum transaction amounts, etc. Categories: Target specific product categories within the Milestone. Line Items: Apply the Milestone to specific products or SKUs. Transaction Amount: Set minimum or maximum purchase amounts for Milestone progress.\n\nRule-Based Filtering:\n\nFor further refinement, you can define specific rules in the rule box. These rules can target particular line items, categories, minimum transaction amounts, etc.\n\nCategories: Target specific product categories within the Milestone.\n\nLine Items: Apply the Milestone to specific products or SKUs.\n\nTransaction Amount: Set minimum or maximum purchase amounts for Milestone progress.\n\nNote\n\nFor line item-related rules, ensure that \"lineitem\" is selected as the target entity. Writing line item-related rules when \"transaction\" is selected as the target entity will lead to errors.\n\nTender-based rules are not supported in the rule box of milestones. For use cases related to tender-based rules, please reach out to a member of the product team.\n\nFor more information on writing rules, refer to the Profiles documentation .\n\nCreating a sub-target\n\nSub-targets are smaller goals configured within a larger target. This enables brands to nudge and motivate customers and reward them at smaller intervals during the target journey.\n\nTo create a sub-target, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the target section of a milestone.\n\nNavigate to the target section of a milestone.\n\nClick Add sub-target.\n\nClick Add sub-target.\n\nEnter a name for the sub-target.\n\nEnter a name for the sub-target.\n\nSelect the achievement criteria from the drop-down menu The achievement criteria are as follows:\n\nSelect the achievement criteria from the drop-down menu\n\nThe achievement criteria are as follows:\n\nAchievement criteria\n\nDescription\n\nPercentage value\n\nDefine a percentage of the main target required to achieve the sub-target. This is applicable only for the following transactional activities : gross amount (total transaction amount excluding discounts) and  net amount (total transaction amount with discounts applied).\n\n*Example**: Achieve 20% of the main target to receive a discount coupon.\n\nAbsolute value\n\nDefine a specific achievement value required to achieve the sub-target.\n\n*Example:** Achieve ₹5000 in purchases to to receive a discount coupon\n\nSelect Continue to confirm the changes.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nNote\n\nWhen editing a milestone, the sub-target achievement criteria type cannot be modified, and only the amount can be updated.\n\nUse case :\n\nConsider a scenario where a brand wants to incentivise customers for purchasing specific accessories at a store. A milestone with a target value of ₹10,000 is set and includes the following sub-targets:\n\n20% Achievement (₹2000): Send a message acknowledging progress and encouraging further effort.\n\n50% Achievement (₹5000): Incentivise the customer with a small reward, such as a discount or coupon code, to encourage continued progress.\n\n100% Achievement (₹10,000): When the full target is reached, grant a substantial reward, such as a free accessory or an exclusive offer.\n\nThese sub-targets enable the brand to actively engage with customers throughout their journey, providing personalized communication and motivating them with timely rewards.\n\nCreating milestones using templates\n\nTemplates are pre-configured milestones based on a pre-defined use case. These templates expedite the milestone creation process by automatically populating essential values for various use cases. As a user, you only need to provide the remaining information.\n\nNote: Templates for all kinds of use cases might not be available.\n\nFor example, the following are some of the templates available:\n\nTemplate on \"Catalyze product sales\n\nWhenever a brand wants to boost the sales of a particular product using the Milestone, they can choose this milestone template. This template comes pre-filled with all the essential information required to configure and achieve the intended use case. As a brand, your responsibility is to complete the remaining details, such as the number of cycles, dates, etc.\n\nTemplate on \"Boost customer spend\n\nThis template is tailor-made to increase customer spending and comes pre-filled with all the necessary information, including rules, filters, etc. As a brand, your task is to fill in the remaining details.\n\nNote: Upon selecting a template, you can also edit the pre-filled data. As a brand, if you wish to change the pre-filled values to other specific values, that option is also available.\n\nCloning/Duplicating a Milestone\n\nOnce a Milestone is created, it can be cloned to create another Milestones. This helps the brands in saving time when they are creating similar milestones.\n\nTo clone a Milestone, hover over the Milestone that you want to clone and click the Duplicate icon.\n\nFor example:\n\nA brand 'Jaffna' has created a milestone that a user has to achieve $100 gross sales in a month to get 100 points. For this milestone, they have configured 5 cycles. However, they also want to create another Milestone and the only difference is, this time the brand wants the KPI as $100 net sales.\n\nHere, as the entire information is the same, now brand can clone the previous milestone and change the KPI from gross sales to net sales.\n\nNotes\n\nCloning can be done only from a Live/Upcoming Milestone.\n\nWhen the cloning is completed, the \"customer enrollment\" step won't be cloned. Customer enrollment details needs to be entered before saving the clone.\n\nAdvanced settings of milestones\n\nThe advanced settings is a page that contains advanced options for the milestone which brands can use to improve their gamification, enable default options, etc... This is how to go to advanced settings:\n\nWhen the configurer clicks on the \"advanced settings\" on the top-right corner, the following page opens up:\n\nCurrently, this page contains the following advanced options:\n\nEnabling leaderboard on each milestone level Leaderboard is a concept that brands can use to improve their gamification by creating competition among the users for additional users. More information on the leaderboard can be found here Currently, the following are the 2 APIs that are supported for the leaderboard Fetching top-N customers Fetching the rank of a customer across target groups\n\nLeaderboard is a concept that brands can use to improve their gamification by creating competition among the users for additional users.\n\nMore information on the leaderboard can be found here Currently, the following are the 2 APIs that are supported for the leaderboard Fetching top-N customers Fetching the rank of a customer across target groups\n\nCurrently, the following are the 2 APIs that are supported for the leaderboard Fetching top-N customers Fetching the rank of a customer across target groups\n\nFetching top-N customers\n\nFetching the rank of a customer across target groups\n\nExamples for overall targets\n\nExample 1:\n\nA fitness brand creates the following targets to encourage customer engagement and activity:\n\nDance for 15 minutes daily\n\nJog for 30 minutes daily\n\nDo yoga for 30 minutes daily.\n\nCustomers who complete all three activities daily receive the “Fit Today” badge.\n\nTo motivate customers to exceed their goals, the brand includes an Overall Target: stay active for at least 120 minutes per day. Customers who meet the Overall Target receive the “Superfit Today” badge.\n\nBy creating a unified target that tracks three behavioral events and including an overall target lets the brand incentivise their customers for their consistent engagement, encourages brand loyalty, and aligns customer goals with the brand’s mission to promote active lifestyles.\n\nExample 2:\n\nA brand creates the following targets to encourage customer participation in its loyalty program:\n\nRedeem 10 coupons monthly\n\nEarn 100 loyalty points per transaction\n\nRedeem 50 loyalty points weekly\n\nCustomers who complete all three targets receive a 15% discount coupon.\n\nTo encourage consistent engagement, the brand adds an Overall Target: accumulate 500 loyalty points monthly. Customers who meet this target receive an Additional 20% Discount Coupon.\n\nBy creating a unified target that tracks coupon redemptions, points earned, and points redeemed and including an overall monthly goal, the brand incentivises repeat purchases, boosts sales volume, and aligns customer behaviour with its loyalty program objectives.\n\nExample 3:\n\nA fashion brand creates the following targets to boost sales across different categories:\n\nPurchase at least ₹1,000 from the Men’s category\n\nPurchase at least ₹1,000 from the Women’s category\n\nPurchase at least ₹500 from the Children’s category\n\nTo incentivise larger purchases, the brand adds an Overall Target: spend at least ₹5,000 in total to earn a 20% Discount Coupon.\n\nBy creating a unified target that tracks purchases across three categories and including an overall spending goal, the brand incentivises cross-category sales, drives higher revenue, and aligns customer spending habits with its goal of boosting category-wide performance.\n\nViewing a milestone\n\nThe details of a milestone can be viewed by clicking on the milestone from the list.\n\nConfiguration The configuration tab displays configuration information of the milestone in view.\n\nInformation\n\nThe information tab displays information of the milestone in view.\n\nConfiguring benefits\n\nThis step involves defining benefits for end-users upon achieving the configured milestone. The configuration is performed by setting up Loyalty promotions .\n\nTo create Milestone-related promotions, you need to use the \"target period elapses\" customer activity and define rules based on your Milestones to configure actions such as benefits, communication, etc.\n\nHow the EMF behaves b/w Milestones & Loyalty promotions\n\nThe below flow chart provides you with an overview of EMF (Engagement Metric Factor) flow in Capillary and how Milestones and loyalty promotions are connected via EMF.\n\nIn this flow, the orange line indicates that after milestone evaluation, if necessary, an event will be sent to promotions via EMF.\n\nThis happens in two ways:\n\nImmediate effect - When a customer's \"target achieved\" surpasses the \"target defined,\" the brand aims to provide benefits immediately. Therefore, an immediate event request will be sent only when \"targetAchieved > targetDefined\" is in this process.\n\nEnd of the cycle - The milestone evaluation for all customers occurs only at the end of the cycle (and point allocation will also happen after the period ends aka the next day). This is similar to a scheduled task that runs after each cycle, triggering an event request. In this approach, an event request is sent even if \"targetAchieved < targetDefined,\" enabling a broader range of use cases with the assistance of rules.\n\nGenerally, the B2C use cases follow method (1) where instant gratification is required and B2B use cases follow method (2) where instant gratification has no role & the brand wants to wait till the end of the cycle to let their customers achieve as high as possible so that they can be awarded accordingly.\n\nAs a brand, if you want to enable immediate effect (Immediate effect), make sure the following config is enabled (mark as \"Active\") in your org settings. When this config is enabled, only then, Milestone will send an event request to EMF as soon as a customer's \"target achieved\" is greater than \"target defined\".\n\nWhen this config is \"Inactive\", no event request will be sent to EMF on immediate basis. By default, this will be in \"Active\" phase.\n\nOnce the event reaches loyalty promotions through either of the two methods mentioned above, the promotion undergoes evaluation based on the rules, scope, etc., specified in that promotion. After all evaluations are complete, the associated actions, such as awarding points, distributing coupons, communication, etc., will be triggered.\n\nRules for the Loyalty promotions about Milestones\n\nThis applies only to targets for which the benefits are not immediately provided.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nMake sure that the vertical 'Target Loyalty' is enabled. To add the vertical to enabled verticals, perform the following: Navigate to Organisation settings > Master Data Management> Extended Field > Extended Fields Vertical Mapping . Select Target Loyalty from Disabled Verticals. Click add to add it to the Enabled Verticals.\n\nNavigate to Organisation settings > Master Data Management> Extended Field > Extended Fields Vertical Mapping .\n\nSelect Target Loyalty from Disabled Verticals.\n\nClick add to add it to the Enabled Verticals.\n\nMake sure the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config is set as \"active\" in the EMF org settings page. Awards will be given to the user (for milestones/streaks) only when this config is set as \"active\". To enable this, visit the \"EMF Configuration\" page of org settings. If the access to the page is not given, write an email to the sustenance team.\n\nRules\n\nAll the rules related to milestones come under the \"currentEvent\" profile. This means that the \"currentEvent\" profile has many attributes about Milestones. They are:\n\ncurrentEvent.targetAchieved\n\ncurrentEvent.targetDefined\n\ncurrentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent\n\ncurrentEvent.milestoneValueDefined\n\ncurrentEvent.targetGaps\n\ncurrentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger\n\ncurrentEvent.targetName\n\ncurrentEvent.targetPeriod\n\ncurrentEvent.targetAchieved\n\nThis rule helps in getting the current target achieved value of the customer. Make sure that, you are entering the name of the milestone inside the parenthesis.\n\nE.g: currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\")\n\ncurrentEvent.targetDefined\n\nThis rule helps in getting the target defined value by the brand for that Milestone. Similar to the above, make sure you are entering the name of the milestone in the parenthesis.\n\nE.g: currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\")\n\nFor example, if you write a rule: currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\")>currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\"), this rule will become true only when the customer's achieved value is more than the defined value.\n\ncurrentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent\n\nThis rule verifies whether the event that came to loyalty promotions (out of 100s of type of events that are possible) is the event that arrives whenever a user achieves the milestone (aka target).\n\nFor instance, if you've set up a Milestone where a user needs to achieve $1000 in sales from Jan 1st to Jan 20th. If the user reaches this target by Jan 5th, brands have two options:\n\nInstant Gratification: Provide benefits right away to the customer, which is common in B2C industries.\n\nEnd-of-Cycle Evaluation: Delays the evaluation until the end of the cycle, allowing customers to achieve more. This approach is common in B2B industries.\n\nBy including the \"ENABLE_AWARDS_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" rule in the rule box (assuming it's marked as \"Active\" as shown above), benefits will be immediately given to customers when the target is achieved.\n\nFor example, if you write a rule: (currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\") > currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\")) && (currentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent == true), then the benefits will be given immediatley.\n\nPlease note that, if you want to do the evaluation ONLY at the end of the cycle, you have to make the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" as \"Inactive\" in the EMF configuration page of org settings.\n\nENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\n\n(config)\n\nisTargetAchievedEvent\n\n(rule expression)\n\nThe behavior of the EMF\n\nActive\n\ntrue\n\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > target Defined. Again, at the end of the cycle/period. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\n\nThe rule expression becomes true when the targetAchieved > target Defined.\n\nActive\n\nfalse\n\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > target Defined. Again, at the end of the cycle. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\n\nThe rule expression becomes true at the end of the cycle/period.\n\nActive\n\nThis rule is not written.\n\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > targetDefined. Again, at the end of the cycle. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\n\nHowever, because of not writing the rule in the promotions, the evaluation also happens twice. Once when achieved > defined, and again at the end of the cycle.\n\nSo, a customer will get benefits twice.\n\nInactive\n\ntrue\n\nThe event will come to loyalty at the end of the cycle or period as the config is \"Inactive\". This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\n\nInactive\n\nfalse\n\nThe event will come to loyalty at the end of the cycle or period as the config is \"Inactive\". This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\n\ncurrentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger\n\nThis rule configures actions for various triggers of the Milestone, such as \"sub-targets.\"\n\nFor example, if you set a condition that \"a user has to make 1000 gross sales in a month to get 100 points,\" and you also want to send a message when 70% of the target is achieved, you can use sub-targets.\n\nIf you have created one sub-target named \"ABC1\" at 30% & another sub-target named \"ABC2\" at 60%,  the rule currentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger.contains(\"ABC1\") will be triggered when 30% is achieved and the rule currentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger.contains(\"ABC2\") will be triggered when 60% is achieved.\n\ncurrentEvent.milestoneValueDefined\n\nThis rule provides the value of the sub-target configured on the total target. For instance, if you set a milestone that \"a user has to make 20 transactions in a quarter to get 100 points\" and configure a sub-target at 80% of the total target, this rule can be useful. Suppose a user has made 18 transactions in that quarter. A sub-target event will be sent to loyalty promotions from the milestones as the sub-target has been achieved.\n\nIn the event evaluation, the rule currentEvent.milestoneValueDefined will return the value as 16 (80% of 20 is 16, the sub-target value). Brands can use this rule to achieve various use cases where the sub-target value is needed in their strategy.\n\ncurrentEvent.targetGaps\n\nThis rule returns the difference between the \"targetDefined\" and \"targetAchieved\" values of the customer. Use this rule to address use cases where strategic decisions need to be made based on gaps.\n\nFor example, writing the rule currentEvent.targetGaps(\"ABC\") where \"ABC\" is the name of the milestone will return the difference between these values. If user 'X' has achieved a target value of 700 while the defined value is 500, this rule will return the gap between those values.\n\ncurrentEvent.targetName\n\nThis rule enables the creation of rules based on the names of milestones. For instance, as a brand, if you want to execute specific actions for a particular milestone, you can use this rule.\n\nFor example, if you have a milestone named \"ABC\" and you wish to perform specific actions exclusively for this milestone, you can utilize the rule currentEvent.targetName.contains(\"ABC\") .\n\ncurrentEvent.targetPeriod\n\nThis rule enables you to execute specific actions or implement particular strategies based on the name of the period. For instance, if you have a milestone named \"ABC\" with three periods—'X', 'Y', 'Z'—you may want to perform certain actions when the event for the period 'X' is sent to loyalty promotions. This rule, currentEvent.targetPeriod.contains(\"X\") , helps you achieve that.\n\nNote: The target names and period names are unique across the entire organization, eliminating any duplication issues.\n\nSample use cases & their configuration\n\nUse case 1: Instant benefit delivery\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\n\nResult: When a customer's \"targetAchieved\" exceeds \"targetDefined,\" an event is sent to loyalty promotions, triggering configured actions.\n\nUse Case 2: Delayed benefits at the end of the cycle\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Inactive\".\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\n\nResult: At the end of each cycle, an automated process will run, sending an event to the loyalty promotions for all customers associated with the milestones. Subsequently, the loyalty promotions module will assess the rules and activate the pre-configured actions.\n\nUse Case 3: Sending a message at the end of a cycle\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Inactive\".\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\n\nResult: At the end of each cycle, a message will be sent to all the customers.\n\nUse Case 4: Sending message immediately on achieving the target\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\n\nResult: A message will be sent immediately once the achieved value is more than the defined target value.\n\nUse Case 5: Configuring two targets in a single promotion\n\nThe \"immediate effect\" method is used here.  Make the necessary config & rule change for the \"end of cycle\" method, keeping the targetName rule intact.\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\n\nResult: Two milestones (ABC & XYZ) are defined and both of them are configured in a single promotion.\n\nWarning\n\nHaving two milestones (ABC & XYZ) configured in a single promotion creates a challenge for auditing. It becomes difficult to determine the points allocated to each milestone as a liability.\n\nUse Case 6: Configuring sub-Target actions\n\nA brand configured a sub-target, that at 70% of the target achievement, they want to send a communication to their users.\n\nA sub-target at 70% should be created first in the Milestone to achieve this use case.\n\nStep 1: Set the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\" or \"Inactive' as required.\n\nStep 2: Configure the rules in the loyalty promotions as follows:\n\nIn this case, the rule becomes \"true\" when the customer achieves 70% of the target, indicating the fulfillment of the sub-target. The configuration settings determine whether sub-target actions take effect immediately or at the end of the period.\n\nNote\n\nThe above usecases are some of the examples only. You can configure and achieve more usecases using these rules. Read the document and use cases properly before configuring the Mielstones.\n\nAlso, note that the adjustment of target-value upon return transaction work only when the \"ALLOW_RETURN_ON_TARGET\" config is enabled as true in the EMF configurations.\n\nConfiguring Milestone Settings\n\nYou can configure how customers’ progress toward a milestone or streak is tracked and adjusted in scenarios such as returns, cancellations, or mid-cycle enrolment. These configurations ensure fairness and accuracy in reward eligibility.\n\nAccessing the Milestone settings page\n\nTo access the Milestones settings page, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the milestones listing page .\n\nNavigate to the milestones listing page .\n\nSelect the icon in the upper-right corner.\n\nSelect the icon in the upper-right corner.\n\nYou can configure the following settings:\n\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions: Adjust milestone values when the entire bill is returned Adjust milestone values when line items are returned\n\nAdjust milestone values when the entire bill is returned\n\nAdjust milestone values when line items are returned\n\nSet buffer periods for retro transactions\n\nInclude past transactions and behavioural events when a customer enrols in a milestone mid-cycle\n\nEnable leaderboards for all milestones\n\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions\n\nAdjust milestone values when the entire bill is returned\n\nYou can define how the system adjusts milestone values and progress after a customer returns or cancels an entire purchase.\n\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\n\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\n\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\n\nA customer does the following:\n\nMakes three purchases in January: ₹2,000, ₹1,500, and ₹3,000. They become eligible to earn 100 points after the third purchase.\n\nReturns the product worth ₹3,000 on 31st of January.\n\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\n\nWhen the setting is disabled , the milestone values and earned points are not adjusted for returns in any cycle.\n\nWhen the setting is disabled , the milestone values and earned points are not adjusted for returns in any cycle.\n\nWhen the setting is enabled , the earned points are not deducted in the current cycle (January). In the subsequent cycle (February), the milestone starts at a negative (-) ₹3,000 for the customer. The customer must spend ₹8,000 (₹5,000 + ₹3,000) to be eligible to earn points in February.

In the subsequent cycle (February), the milestone starts at a negative (-) ₹3,000 for the customer. The customer must spend ₹8,000 (₹5,000 + ₹3,000) to be eligible to earn points in February.\n\nWhen “Adjust milestone values in subsequent period/cycle within milestone” is enabled\n\nTo enable adjusting milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions, follow these steps:\n\nAccess the milestones settings page .\n\nEnable the toggle under Adjust milestone values in subsequent period/cycle within milestone group\n\nSelect Save to save the changes.\n\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\n\nAdjust milestone values when line items are returned\n\nFor line-item-based milestones , you can choose how the system adjusts the milestone value when a customer returns a single or multiple line items (not the entire bill).\n\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\n\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\n\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\n\nA customer does the following:\n\nPurchases the following items in January: 2 yoga mats: ₹2,000 (₹1,000 each) 2 water bottles: ₹1,500 (₹750 each) 1 pair of shoes: ₹3,000\n\n2 yoga mats: ₹2,000 (₹1,000 each)\n\n2 water bottles: ₹1,500 (₹750 each)\n\n1 pair of shoes: ₹3,000\n\nReturns the following items on 31st of January: 1 yoga mat (₹1,000) 1 water bottle (₹750) Total Returned: ₹1,750\n\n1 yoga mat (₹1,000)\n\n1 water bottle (₹750) Total Returned: ₹1,750\n\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\n\nProrate as per line item amount and adjust milestone value: The value is proportionally adjusted based on the total bill amount.\n\nThe returned amount (₹1,750) represents 26.9% of the original purchase total (₹6,500).\n\nThe system prorates this ratio against the ₹5,000 milestone target: ₹5,000 × 26.9% = ₹1,346.15 adjustment.\n\n₹5,000 × 26.9% = ₹1,346.15 adjustment.\n\nIn February, the customer’s milestone progress starts at -₹1,346.15, requiring them to spend ₹6,346.15 (₹5,000 + ₹1,346.15) to earn points.\n\nDo not adjust milestone value: The return is ignored, and the milestone value is not adjusted.\n\nTo configure adjusting milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions for line items, follow these steps:\n\nAccess the milestones settings page .\n\nAccess the milestones settings page .\n\nSelect the appropriate radio button under For line item based milestones, if return is on transaction amount .\n\nSelect the appropriate radio button under For line item based milestones, if return is on transaction amount .\n\nSelect Save to save the changes.\n\nSelect Save to save the changes.\n\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\n\nSet buffer periods for retro transactions\n\nYou can define a buffer period for including past customer purchases in milestone calculations.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/unified-milestones", "title": "Unified target/milestones", "text": "Unified target/milestones\n\nThis document provides you with information on Unified milestones.\n\nA unified target, also called unified milestones, can be achieved by completing two or more individual targets. This enables brands to configure multiple targets in a single milestone for their customers, and reward them for achieving all the targets. Unified targets help brands improve their sales across verticals, across categories, and sales across a specific category by giving customers various targets.\n\nComponents of a unified target\n\nA unified milestone primarily consists of the following:\n\nMultiple targets (at least 2 targets need to be present)\n\nA logical operator (ALL or ANY) between the specified targets. Users can choose ALL or ANY, but not a mix between the targets.\n\nAn overall target if a brand desires (currently supported only for the ALL operator & transaction type activity ).\n\nSupported only for fixed calendar window (aka only when the \"start date of the first cycle\" is specified explicitly by the brand)\n\nNote\n\nA maximum limit of 10 targets can be created in a unified milestone.\n\nUse case 1\n\nXYZ, a leading conglomerate, operates across various sectors, including electronics, fashion, groceries, medicines, and more. Customers enjoy unique benefits by engaging in cross-vertical purchases, including:\n\nBuying any two electronic items from the electronics vertical.\n\nMaking a minimum jewelry purchase of $1000 from the fashion vertical.\n\nCompleting five transactions, each amounting to a minimum of $10, within the e-commerce vertical.\n\nUpon reaching the specified targets, users can redeem a $30 coupon.\n\nUse case 2\n\nA customer of a fuel brand can earn rewards by meeting specific purchase targets, which include:\n\nBuying a minimum of 5 liters of a specified quality of petrol.\n\nMaking purchases in the food & beverages category totaling at least $30.\n\nUpon successfully achieving these targets within a specified timeframe, the user is eligible to receive 300 points as a reward.\n\nUse case 3\n\nTo meet the target set by a renowned electronics brand, a user is required to:\n\nBuy electronics with a minimum total value of $600, fulfilling all of the following conditions:\n\nPurchase heavy electronics amounting to $150.\n\nConduct 5 transactions, each valued at a minimum of $30.\n\nMake 3 visits, each with a minimum expenditure of $50.\n\nPurchase any combination of 5 electronic items.\n\nCreating a unified target\n\nTo create a unified target, navigate to the Milestone page and follow a process similar to creating a regular Milestone . However, for unified targets, do the following in the \"target activity\" step:\n\nChoose the Same target value for each cycle option.\n\nYou'll see a section asking for details about a single target.\n\nConfigure the KPI on which the single target needs to be created.\n\nFrom the drop-down set the scope of the target (like rules, stores, zones, etc..)\n\nTo add another target, click Add target.\n\nEnter the details of the second target.\n\nToggle the slider to enable Overall target . The Overall target is applicable only when the activity is a \" transaction type \" for all the targets and \" all \" the targets need to be achieved. This is optional and applies to scenarios such as Use case 3 where you have an overall target and individual targets with \"all\" as a condition between them. The Overall target option cannot be used with the operator \"ANY\".\n\nToggle the slider to enable Overall target . The Overall target is applicable only when the activity is a \" transaction type \" for all the targets and \" all \" the targets need to be achieved. This is optional and applies to scenarios such as Use case 3 where you have an overall target and individual targets with \"all\" as a condition between them. The Overall target option cannot be used with the operator \"ANY\".\n\nBy default, when you add a new target, \"ALL\" will be configured between them. However, from the drop-down, choose All or ANY to define the target conditions that need to be achieved. Select  ALL for scenarios such as Use case 2 or select ANY and define the number of targets that need to be achieved if only a certain number of the defined targets need to be achieved.\n\nBy default, when you add a new target, \"ALL\" will be configured between them.

You cannot add a sub-target for a unified target.\n\nClick Done . A unified target has been successfully created.\n\nBenefits can be given for unified targets in the following ways:\n\nFor the whole unified target achievement\n\nFor the achievement of an individual target inside the unified target\n\nExample: Say, there is an unified target called \"ABC\" that has 3 targets (X, Y, Z) in it.\n\nX: User has to purchase $100 in a month\n\nY: User has to make 3 transactions in a month\n\nZ: User has to update profile picture 2 times in a month\n\nHere, say the rewarding is: If user achieves ANY(2) of the 3, will get 500 points. However, the brand also wants to reward 100 points whenever the user achieves individual target also.\n\nFor the unified achievement, write the rule \"currentEvent.isUnifiedTargetAchievedEvent\" in the rule-box on the promotions side. Add the \"issue points\" action by selecting the 'unified target' as the response for the 'target(s)' after selecting the correct option (aka 'ABC' here) in 'Milestones/Streaks' drop-down. In the unified achievement case, pro-rate won't work as there is no source value.\n\nFor the unified achievement, write the rule \"currentEvent.isUnifiedTargetAchievedEvent\" in the rule-box on the promotions side.

For example, to configure the benefit of 100 points for 'X' target which is present inside the unified target: Write the rule currentEvent.targetExists(\"X\") && (currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"X\")>=currentEvent.targetDefined(\"X\")) in the rule-box.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/alternate-currencies", "title": "Alternate Currencies", "text": "Alternate Currencies\n\nThis page information of alternate currencies, aka a new set of currencies similar to points for implementing various market use cases like starts, stamps, tier points, etc..\n\nNote\n\nAlternate currencies are not available for all organisations. Contact your CSM to enable alternate currencies for your organisation.\n\nAlternate Currencies are a variation of the reward currencies (points) . Some of the prominent features of alternate currencies are:\n\nThey can have an image associated with them (for example, a stamp image for the stamp currency).\n\nThese can be made active or inactive as per the use case.\n\nOperates at the program level rather than the organization level.\n\nExample\n\nIn the E-commerce, Gaming, or Entertainment sectors, brands often offer various incentives such as stars, stamps, boosts, and more to engage their customers. These currencies serve specific purposes, including exchanging stamps for reward catalog items and using boosts to advance to the next level.\n\nA high-level view of the incentives with these Alternate Currencies looks like below:\n\nAlternate Currencies can be also provided along with other incentives such as points, coupons, and badges during a transaction. For instance, in the airline industry, you may wish to reward customers with regular points equivalent to 3% of their transaction value. If a customer spends $1000, they would receive 30 regular points.\n\nHowever, suppose your brand strategy dictates that regular points should not be used for tier-related activities like upgrades or downgrades. In that case, you might introduce a new currency called \"tier points\" for such purposes.\n\nFor example, if you decide to allocate 5% of these \"Alternate Currencies,\" also known as \"tier points,\" per transaction, the customer would earn 50 tier points alongside their regular points.\n\nCreating Alternate Currency\n\nTo create Alternate Currencies, perform the following steps:\n\nGo to the loyalty program in which the currency needs to be created.\n\nClick Edit program if not already in the edit flow.\n\nClick Advanced settings .\n\nClick Reward currencies .\n\nClick the New reward currency CTA.\n\nEnter the required details needed to create the currency: Name of the new currency.The maximum limit for the name is 30 characters Description of the new currency Activate/Deactivate: Similar to promotions, an active/inactive status can be assigned to Alternate Currencies. This is an editable feature, so this can be updated as & when needed. Duration: By default, currency is valid from the date of creation to 99 years. However, a custom duration can also be configured depending on the use case. This can be helpful when the brand wants to allocate alternate currency only during a specific duration. Image: Each Alternate Currency must be assigned an image, which will serve as a symbol of the currency. For example, you can upload a stamp image when creating a stamp alternate currency. Redeemability of Alternate Currency: Alternate currencies can only be earned. Redeeming alternate currencies is not supported. Return of Alternate currency: If a brand desires, the return property (return & return re-evaluation) can be revoked for an alternate currency. This is an irreversible property once created. Reward currency conversion: Similar to the feature in points, each Alternate Currency can also be assigned a conversion value.\n\nName of the new currency.The maximum limit for the name is 30 characters\n\nDescription of the new currency\n\nActivate/Deactivate: Similar to promotions, an active/inactive status can be assigned to Alternate Currencies.

To view, navigate to Loyalty program > Edit program > Advanced settings > Reward currencies.\n\nThis listing page displays Alternate Currency with the below information:\n\nName, Image uploaded, and Created by.\n\nStatus & duration.\n\nIf the currency is redeemable or not, and returnable or not.\n\nLast updated by\n\nAlternate Currencies in MLP\n\nAlternate Currencies are created at the program level and their entire life cycle exists within the program itself.\n\nFor instance, consider an MLP organization called ABC, which comprises five distinct programs established based on different verticals of operation:\n\nFashion (fashion vertical)\n\nElectro (electronics vertical)\n\nGrocer (groceries vertical)\n\nHosp (hospitality vertical)\n\nSport (sports vertical)\n\nNow, if the brand introduces an Alternate Currency named 'boosts' within the Sport program, the users earn these boosts through purchases from Sport, and they can only utilize them within the Sport program.\n\nDistribution of Alternate Currencies\n\nSince Alternate Currencies function in parallel with points, brands can distribute them like points through loyalty programs & loyalty promotions. These can't distributed through Engage+ as of now.\n\nAlternate currencies can be distributed from both loyalty programs & loyalty promotions. In the actions, the brand can find \"Issue {{AC name}}\" actions for all the ACs configured in the program. The behavior of this action will be similar to \"transaction point allocation\" for transaction-based activity, \"allocation of points\" for behavioral event-based activity, and \"target point allocation\" for milestone/streak related activity.\n\nAlternate currencies can be issued for customer activities such as AddTransaction, Milestone/Streak is updated (also called as Target period elapsed), and Generic events. The conditions (Earn, Expiry, Return) configured for points can also be applied to the distribution of Alternate Currencies. Delayed strategies (aka promised points strategies) that we currently support for points are not supported for alternate currencies.\n\nThe conditions (Earn, Expiry, Return) configured for points can also be applied to the distribution of Alternate Currencies. Delayed strategies (aka promised points strategies) that we currently support for points are not supported for alternate currencies.\n\nDelayed strategies (aka promised points strategies) that we currently support for points are not supported for alternate currencies.\n\nOnce the support of redemption is available for ACs, then the redemption conditions created for points can be used for alternate currencies as well.\n\nExample\n\nSuppose a brand has established an Alternate Currency named \"tier points\" and wishes to allocate these points to customers for various activities. This can be accomplished as follows:\n\nHere, similar to points, the necessary earn condition, expiry condition, etc., must be selected according to the use case. Once these selections are made and saved, they begin to appear in the actions.\n\nAlternate Currencies in Tracker: managing double liability\n\nConsider a brand running a promotion offering 5%, 10%, and 15% points to customers categorized as bronze, silver, and gold. Reusing the same points for tier-related actions, such as upgrades or downgrades, poses a double liability risk. This arises because:\n\nUsers can redeem the points.\n\nUsers can utilize the same points to upgrade to another tier, increasing the brand's liability further.\n\nTo address this challenge, you can create an Alternate Currency and a tracker to monitor and minimize double liability concerns. For example, for the above use case, you can create an Alternate Currency 'Tier Points' and track the entity.\n\nSome important points regarding ACs in trackers:\n\nTrackers created on alternate currencies won't be available in the tracker set/points tracker set.\n\nThey can be accessed directly from any set using the following rules: currentCustomer.trackerValueBeforeEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user excluding the current event. currentCustomer.trackerValueCurrentEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user including the earnings from the current event until before set.\n\ncurrentCustomer.trackerValueBeforeEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user excluding the current event.\n\ncurrentCustomer.trackerValueCurrentEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user including the earnings from the current event until before set.\n\nAs these trackers are not tightly coupled with tracker set/points tracker set, the above rules can be written in loyalty promotion also. This means that tracker information can be accessed from promotions also which was not possible before.\n\nTo create a tracker based on alternate currency:\n\nLogin to your respective org\n\nLogin to your respective org\n\nClick on the 9-dot symbols in the top-left corner\n\nClick on the 9-dot symbols in the top-left corner\n\nClick on Loyalty+\n\nClick on Loyalty+\n\nClick on your loyalty program\n\nClick on your loyalty program\n\nClick on \"Edit program\"\n\nClick on \"Edit program\"\n\nGo to the \"Trackers\" section in the workflow\n\nGo to the \"Trackers\" section in the workflow\n\nClick on \"Add new tracker\". When you do the above, the following screen appears. In this, all the configs of trackers will work as it is. However, to create a tracker based on an alternate currency, the corresponding currency has to be selected in the tracked entity. Say, there are 2 alternate currencies (stars, tier points) present in your program: Then both the stars & tier points will appear as options in the \"tracked entity\"\n\nClick on \"Add new tracker\".\n\nWhen you do the above, the following screen appears.\n\nIn this, all the configs of trackers will work as it is.\n\nHowever, to create a tracker based on an alternate currency, the corresponding currency has to be selected in the tracked entity. Say, there are 2 alternate currencies (stars, tier points) present in your program: Then both the stars & tier points will appear as options in the \"tracked entity\"\n\nThen both the stars & tier points will appear as options in the \"tracked entity\"\n\nClick on \"Save\" to create the tracker\n\nClick on \"Save\" to create the tracker\n\nTracker based on alternate currencies in workflows:\n\nOnce a tracker based on alternate currency is created successfully, it can be used right away in workflows. One important differentiation between these trackers from normal trackers is, that there is no need to go to the \"Trackers\" or \"Points Tracker\" section in the workflow to use them.\n\nRather, these trackers can be used in the normal sets directly making them very flexible. All the tracker rules that are currently supported for trackers will be supported for the trackers based on alternate currencies too.\n\nTrackers based on alternate currencies in tier settings.\n\nOnce a tracker based on alternate currency is created successfully, the same tracker can be used in tier settings as well to configure the upgrade/downgrade/renew conditions.\n\nFor example, say as a brand you have created an alternate currency called \"tier-points\" and you want to do all the tier-related activities based on this currency. To achieve this\n\nCreate a tracker based on alternate currency\n\nOnce it is created successfully, go to the appropriate.\n\nSelect the above tracker in the tracker-based tier-settings configurations\n\nDone\n\nPreview of using the above tracker for tier eligibility:\n\nPreview of using the above tracker for renewal check:\n\nAlternate currencies in MLP\n\nAlternate currencies will be created on the program level. This means that, when an alternate currency is created inside a loyalty program, its entire life cycle exists within the program only.\n\nFor example, say there is an MLP org (Tapa, a conglomerate) that contains 5 programs:\n\nFrona (fashion vertical)\n\nErona (electronics vertical)\n\nGrona (groceries vertical)\n\nHrona (hospitality vertical)\n\nSrona (sports vertical)\n\nNow, whenever an alternate currency (say Pebble) is created in Frona, it can be used only in Frona. This means:\n\nRedemption of the Pebble is possible only in Frona.\n\nTrackers can be created based on Pebble only in Frona.\n\nA new alternate currency called \"Pebble\" can be created in other orgs with the same name, but all of them work independently & confined only to their respective orgs.\n\nAlternate currencies information in APIs\n\nOnce an alternate currency is created, and distributed via workflows/promotions, then the information of them will be available in the following APIs.\n\ngetCustomerLedgerInfo: Link\n\ngetLedgerExplodeInfo: Link\n\ngetCustomerLedgerBalance: Link\n\ngetCustomerDetails V2: Link\n\ngetTransactions V2: Link\n\nThe information of alternate\n\nNotes\n\nAlternate currency information is stored behind query parameters. This approach aims to maintain lightweight and fast APIs.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes an alternate currency have all the capabilities of points? Currently, alternate currencies can be created, distributed, returned, return re-evaluated, and can be tracked using the trackers. However, many core properties like expiry and redemption won't work with them.\n\nCurrently, alternate currencies can be created, distributed, returned, return re-evaluated, and can be tracked using the trackers.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/overview-streaks", "title": "Overview", "text": "Overview\n\nA streak refers to a consecutive series of actions or engagements by a customer, based on which loyalty benefits are provided. The concept of a streak emphasizes the continuity and consistency of customer behavior over time, often leading to rewards or incentives from the loyalty program.\n\nFor example, in a retail loyalty program, a streak may involve a customer making purchases on consecutive days, weeks, or months. Each consecutive action contributes to the customer's streak, and as the streak continues, the customer may unlock additional rewards, bonuses, or higher loyalty tiers.\n\nFor any brand, having a large loyal customer base is an advantage. A loyal customer base can help you create a recurring revenue flow, a reputation in the market, an organic way of getting new users because of strong word-of-mouth, etc... We have many capabilities like loyalty promotions, milestones, campaigns, etc... to achieve that.\n\nSome of the popular streak use cases present in the market:\n\nStreak in social media apps: A user has to share a story or post every day to maintain streak value. The higher the streak value, the more bragging visibility it gives to the user.\n\nStreaks in education apps: A user has to learn continuously / qualify in a test continuously to earn rewards.\n\nStreaks in e-commerce: A user has to open the app 10 times a week for 4 weeks to get 10 points. A user has to provide 1 review in a month for 6 months to get exclusive access to rewards.\n\nStreaks in health & fitness: A user has to walk 5k steps in a day for 10 days to get 1% off on insurance premiums. A user has to drink 3 liters of water per day for 30 days to get 100 points.\n\nand many many more.\n\nWith the Streaks feature in Capillary loyalty programs, you can give some specific tasks to your users and make them do them continuously to get the rewards. This will lead to:\n\nA user base that does specified activity (like purchases, interactions, etc..) continuously.\n\nA recurring source of revenue\n\nIncreased user retention.\n\nSample streak use cases in loyalty\n\nA user has to purchase 1000 gross sales from the electronics category in a week. If the user does this continuously for five weeks, 10 weeks, and 15 weeks, then the user will get 10, 50, and 100 points.\n\nA user has to log into the brand's mobile application five times a month from their mobile. If the user does this continuously for three months or five months, then the user will get a $2, or $5 coupon.\n\nA user has to refer three new customers in a quarter. If the user does this continuously for two quarters or three quarters, then the user will get a silver badge or a gold badge.\n\nA user has to drink at least one coffee (say Espresso) every day. If the user does this for five days, 10 days, or 15 days continuously, then the user will get 5 stars, 10 stars, and 15 stars.\n\nStreaks Vs Milestones\n\nStreaks and Milestones are both powerful gamification capabilities that share common advantages such as increasing user retention, revenue, cross-sales, and incentivization. However, they differ significantly in how they reward a user. Therefore, understanding when to use each capability is essential.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-streaks", "title": "Configure Streaks", "text": "Configure Streaks\n\nAccessing streaks\n\nAttention\n\nBy default, Streaks is not enabled for the orgs. To enable, contact your CSR.\n\nLogin into the homepage of the org where you want to create streaks\n\nClick on the \"profile\" icon on the top-right corner.\n\nClick on the \"Organization settings\".\n\nSearch for \"Streaks\", that's it. You'll be taken to the home page of the streaks.\n\nStreaks home page\n\nThis is how the Streak home page appears.\n\nThis is the Streaks landing page, where all existing streaks are visible. Brands can search for a specific streak using the following criteria:\n\nName of the streak\n\nDuration of the streak: Brings all the streaks that are falling in the given start & end date.\n\nStatus of the streak: There can be 2 types of status Timeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended Activity-based: Active, Inactive\n\nTimeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended\n\nActivity-based: Active, Inactive\n\nThis landing page also provides the following capabilities against each streak:\n\nActivate/Deactivate: A streak can be activated/deactivated depending on the use case by clicking on the 3-dot symbol at the end of each row.\n\nEdit flow of the flow: Once a streak is created, certain components of the streak (like scope, rule, etc...) can be edited by clicking on the \"pencil\" icon at the end of the row.\n\nCreating streak\n\nTo create a new streak, on the home page, click New streak and enter the below details:\n\nBasic details\n\nCustomer enrolment details\n\nActivity details\n\nBasic details\n\nIn the Basic details section, define the following:\n\nName - Name of the streak. Always provide a suitable name (related to your use case) as it helps in searching for the streaks easily in the future.\n\nDescription - A short description of the streak. Always provide a suitable description as it helps in understanding the purpose of the streak in the future.\n\nDuration : Duration for which the Streaks need to be active & running.\n\nFor example, a brand wants to run a weekly streak, requiring its users to make three weekly transactions. If a user accomplishes this for five, ten, and fifteen consecutive weeks, they will receive 10, 20, and 30 points respectively.\n\nIf the brand intends to start this streak on January 10th, 2023, the start date is defined as January 10th, 2023, and the end date is 15 weeks from January 10th, 2023.\n\nA streak can be created with both start & end date in the past. This helps in creating backdated streak type of promotions as when required.\n\nFor example, assume current date is 15th May 2024. On this current date:\n\nCase 1: User could create a streak whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 1st June 2024. In this case, start date is in the past.\n\nCase 2: User could create a streak whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 31st march 2024. In this case, both the start & end date are in the past.\n\nPoints to remember:\n\nPast transactions/events as per the date of creation of the streak has to be re-processes again to consider that past date in the tracking of the streak.\n\nIn the case of 1st case, all the past data as per streak's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 14th May 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. Transactions from 15th May 2024 to the end will be tracked automatically.\n\nIn the case of 2nd case, all the past data as per streak's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 31st March 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. As the streak is ending on 31st March, there is nothing that will be tracked automatically here.\n\nUser can create a past streak upto 6 months in the past. For any use cases where higher limit is needed, reach out to product team.\n\nWhen APIs are being used to create past streak, it may not throw the 6 months validation but be careful when using the APIs directly for compatibility issues.\n\nTill code : Select the till code. This till code is used to attribute all the points that are going out from the streaks module. If you are a brand where there is no concept of till-code present, please create a dummy till-code from the org settings. The same till can be used in milestones as well.\n\nCustomer enrollment\n\nIn the Customer enrolment section, define the audience to whom you want to enroll in the Streaks program.\n\nAll customers: All customers in the organization who have registered for loyalty will become part of the streak.\n\nAudience list: This helps enroll the users into the streaks based on filters, existing user groups, or via CSV upload. This is similar to the audience capability in Engage+ .\n\nNote: This step is the same as the \"customer enrollment\" step in Milestones. For detailed information on this step, please visit the following page: here .\n\nActivity\n\nThis is the core section of the streak where the brand has to configure the below components of the streak:\n\nActivity on which the streak will run, and the associated KPI.\n\nTarget value for each cycle\n\nFrequency of the streak\n\nScope filter & rule filters\n\nLevels of the streak also known as streak definitions\n\nDefining the type of activity on which Streaks need to be created.\n\nCustomer activity refers to the various interactions a customer has with a brand. The table below lists the customer activities that can be tracked for a milestone.\n\nActivity\n\nDescription\n\nExample\n\nTransaction\n\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\n\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\n\nBehavioural event\n\nTrack customer activities like signing up, changing their profile picture, or adding items to their wish list.\n\nA customer adds items to their wish list on the app or website.\n\nEarn reward currency\n\nTrack the reward currencies ( points or alternate currencies ) that a customer has earned during a certain period. The configuration for points and alternate currencies  are the same. You can select only one reward currency per target. To track both points and alternate currencies within the same target / milestone, create a unified milestone with two or more targets and select points or alternate currencies as the reward currencies for each target.\n\nA customer earns 500 reward points for purchasing a ₹5000 jacket during a promotional event.\n\nReferrals\n\nTrack the number of times a customer has successfully referred another person.\n\nA customer refers a friend using a unique link, and the friend makes the first purchase, earning the customer rewards.\n\nPoints redemption\n\nTrack how often customers use their points to redeem rewards, provided redemption is available.\n\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\n\nCoupon redemption\n\nTrack the number of times a customer uses coupons to get discounts or benefits.\n\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\n\nReturning a transaction\n\nTrack the number of transactions a customer returns, whether a full return or part of the purchase.\n\nA customer returns a t-shirt purchased online as it did not fit properly.\n\nUpdating a transaction\n\nTrack how many times a customer changes details about their previous purchases.\n\nA customer orders 1kg bananas and 1kg mangoes but later adjusts the order, reducing the mangoes to 500gms after receiving a partial refund.\n\nUpdating customer profile\n\nTrack how often a customer updates their personal information on their profile.\n\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\n\nPromised points conversion\n\nTrack how many times promised points (temporary or pending rewards) are turned into regular points for the customer.\n\nTransfer points\n\nTrack how many times points are transferred between customers or user groups .\n\nA customer transfers their loyalty points to another customer.\n\nMilestone achieved\n\nTrack how many times a customer completes a target, such as spending a specific amount or completing a behavioral event such as drinking eight litres of water. Notes: The following conditions are required to select a milestone/target to track:\n\nThe milestone/target timeline must be a fixed calendar window.\n\nThe frequency of the milestone must be lower than the milestone being created. For example, if the milestone being tracked has a frequency of daily, then the milestone being created must have a higher frequency like weekly or monthly.\n\nThe duration of the milestone must fit within the milestone being created.\n\nThe milestone must be active.\n\nThe tracking type must be default or unified. This is also supported for streaks, enabling “third-level tracking” use cases. For example: Brush twice a day, six times a week, for ten weeks in a quarter. Walk 5,000 steps a day, five times a week, for three weeks in a month Refer to the documentation for more information on third-level tracking.\n\nA customer achieves a milestone by walking 10,000 steps daily for five consecutive days, as part of a fitness challenge.\n\nPoints redemption reversal\n\nTrack how many times redeemed points are reversed to the customer due to cancellations or errors.\n\nA customer cancels a flight ticket they booked using points, and the points are returned to their account.\n\nTransactional activities: Helps in tracking transactional properties Gross sales (both bill level & line item level) The total gross sales made by the user in the cycle. The gross amount is the amount on the bill before the user avails any kind of discount. Net sales (both bill level & line item level) The total net sales made by the user in the cycle. The net amount is the final amount that the user has paid. This means the discounts will be excluded from the tracking. Quantity (line item level) The number of quantities purchased by the user in the cycle. When used with a specific line item rule, the brand can track the number of specific line items bought by the user in the cycle. Transactions count (bill level) The total number of transactions made by the user in the cycle. Days of activity (bill level) The total number of unique days on which the user has made at least 1 transaction. Transactional extended fields The following KPIs are supported: COUNT: The number of times a transactional extended field came with a specific value. This specific value needs to be configured in the rule box. E.g.: The number of transactions that came with extended field value as \"Gold\". SUM: The sum of the selected transactional extended field in the cycle. Lineitem extended fields The following KPIs are supported: COUNT: The number of times a line-item extended field came with a specific value. This specific value needs to be configured in the rule box. E.g.: The number of line items that came with the extended field value as \"edible food\". SUM: The sum of the selected line-item extended field in the cycle. Reward currencies (aka points): Regular points: Number of regular points earned by the user in the cycle Promotional points: Number of promotional points earned by the user in the cycle Both: Number of total regular & promotional points earned by the user in the cycle\n\nGross sales (both bill level & line item level) The total gross sales made by the user in the cycle.

The following are the supported customer activities: Points redemptions Coupon redemptions Return transaction Points transfer Transaction updates Customer profile updates Promised points conversions Points redemption-reversal Referrals Milestones achieved: This type of tracking is available only during the creation of a fixed-calendar window (aka where a specific start date is selected) type of milestones and helps in tracking how many times a user has achieved a specific target group. Once this tracking is selected, a new drop-down asking to select the target group will appear. A target group will be shown in this drop-down only when it satisfies the following conditions: Fixed-calendar window (aka where a specific start date is selected) type Frequency is inferior to the current milestone's frequency Duration should fit within the current milestone's duration Should be active The tracking type should be either \"default\" or \"unified\". This type of tracking helps in unlocking \"3rd level tracking use cases\" which are extremely difficult to implement. Some of the sample use cases that will be possible are: Brush 2 times a day, 6 times a week, 10 weeks in a quarter Walk 5000 steps a day, 5 times a week, 3 weeks in a month.

For example, rules can be written to target specific line items, categories, minimum transaction amounts, etc.\n\nCategories: Target specific product categories within the Milestone.\n\nLine items: Apply the Milestone to specific products or SKUs.\n\nTransaction amount: Set minimum or maximum purchase amounts for Milestone progress.\n\nStreak levels also known as definitions\n\nIn the text box, you can enter the duration for which the streak should be maintained.\n\nYou can use the toggle switch to disable or enable a non-continuous streak.\n\nConsider a scenario for your coffee brand's loyalty program:\n\nRequirement: Customers must enjoy a cup of your brand's coffee every day.\n\nStreak level/definition: Maintain a streak of 5 months within the streak duration.\n\nStreak Duration: one year\n\nHow it works:\n\nAchievement: Customers achieve the streak by drinking the brand's coffee every single day for a continuous period of 5 months.\n\nBreak Reset: If a customer misses a day, the streak counter resets to zero, and they must start building the streak again from scratch.\n\nNotes:\n\nA user can add 10 different streak definitions in a single streak\n\nStreak levels need to be entered in ascending order.\n\nA user can achieve the streak level \"X+1\", only when the user has already achieved the \"X\" level.\n\nThe maximum streak value should always be \"<=\" number of cycles. For example, say the duration is given as 2 months & frequency is given as weekly, then the maximum number of possible cycles is 8.\n\nNon-continuous streaks\n\nNon-continuous streaks, allow users to maintain a streak without performing the associated activity continuously. In this type of streak, breaks or gaps between performing the activity are permitted, as long as the user completes the activity a specified number of times within a defined timeframe.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/faq", "title": "FAQ", "text": "FAQ\n\nCan I create streaks based on the cyclic calendar window type? As of now, a streak can be created only of fixed calendar window type. This means that, for all the users of the streak, the streak will start & end on the same date.\n\nCan I create streaks where I don't want my user to perform the activity continuously? I'm okay with breaks also as long as the user does the activity 'n' times. This is being called \"non-continuous\" streaks. Yes, this is possible. During the creation flow of the streak, in the \"activity\" step, look for the \"non-continuous\" toggle.\n\nCan I give benefits multiple times for the same level to a user? A user can get the benefits only once for a level in a streak.\n\nWhat is the difference between a continuous streak & non-continuous streak? In the case of the continuous streak, the streak value will reset whenever there is a break in achieving the activity by the user. Think of this as a Snapchat streak. In the case of the non-continuous streak, the streak value won't get reset even if there is a break from the user in achieving the activity. This is more flexible.\n\nHow does the SUM KPI in behavioural events work as I was asked to select an attribute mandatorily? Example: There is a behavioural event created by the brand that always tracks whenever a user walks. The number of steps walked by the user is stored in the attribute of the event to show that to the user on their mobile app. Now, the brand wants to reward its users with 1000 points whenever a user walks 50k steps in a week. In this case, tracking the number of times the user has walked won't help, rather we have to sum the attribute value whenever the event is being triggered. By using this functionality, the use cases like the above can also be achieved.\n\nAre there any filters available where I can filter my customers based on their streak value? As of now, there are no filters available where customers can be filtered on their streak value. Contact the support team whenever you encounter such use cases.\n\nI cannot see the name of the streak definition/levels in the UI, however, it seems that I have to write rules based on the exact level name. How does this work? As of now, you cannot provide a custom name for each level of the streak. This feature will be available in the future. Until then, the name of a streak level will be \"streak name_X\". Say, you have 2 levels in your streak & the name of the streak is ABC. Name of the level 1 is \"ABC_1\" Name of the level 2 is \"ABC_2\".\n\nName of the level 1 is \"ABC_1\"\n\nName of the level 2 is \"ABC_2\".\n\nIs there any support for event notifications in Streaks? As of today, there is no support for event notifications in streaks. However, this feature will be available in the future.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

Liability represents the outstanding points balance as on a given date\n\nThe chart uses month as the dimension and you can expand each month to see the breakup of the different types of debits and adjustments at a date level\n\nPoints event type for adjustment entries may also display as POINTS_DEDUCTED because of how they are stored in the database, they however represent credit entries and you will see values against them in the points credited column\n\nUsing the Liability KPI to create custom charts\n\nIf you rather want to use this chart by considering exclusions, for example, if you want to view the data after excluding fraud customers, you can create a customer chart by using the Liability KPI and then changing the advanced settings as required\n\nYou can use stores, time frames, etc. as dimensions, but when you create custom charts for a particular time period, keep in mind that you should be using the ITD charts only, otherwise the liability data obtained would not be correct. If charts are not ITD, liability data obtained would be only for the specified date range, and that would not be the correct method to look at liability\n\nThe report contains the following charts\n\nPoints can be issued for referral campaigns.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/tier-upgrade", "title": "Tier Upgrade", "text": "Tier Upgrade\n\nA tier upgrade moves a customer from their current tier within a loyalty program to a higher tier which could have more benefits & incentives. Customers receive a tier upgrade when they meet specific eligibility criteria set within the tier configurations or sometimes via workflows (using upgrade-to-tier action).\n\nNote\n\nTier upgrades for a loyalty program can be configured in the advanced settings of the program. Refer to the documentation on advanced settings for more information.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore configuring the eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade, ensure the following are met:\n\nConfigure a loyalty program\n\nCreate the tiers\n\nCreate the trackers\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nA customer can receive a tier upgrade by meeting the eligibility criteria set in the program. The following are the criteria available currently for a tier upgrade:\n\n1. Current points\n\nCurrent points are the active points that a customer has at present. The customer must meet a certain threshold of points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier: 1000 points\n\nThe points the customer holds at present: 900 points\n\nIn this case, the customer must earn 100 more active points to meet the criteria for upgrading the tier. When the customer meets the eligibility criteria of 1000 points , they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n\n2. Lifetime points\n\nLifetime points are the total points a customer has earned throughout their journey in the program. These include active, expired, and redeemed points. The customer must meet a certain threshold of lifetime points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier: 5000 lifetime points\n\nTotal lifetime points customer earned: 3500 points\n\nIn this case, the customer must earn 1500 more points to meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer reaches 5000 lifetime points , they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n\n3. Lifetime purchases\n\nLifetime purchases are the total amount a customer has spent throughout their journey in the program. The customer must meet a certain threshold of lifetime purchases set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier: $5000 lifetime purchases\n\nTotal lifetime purchases of the customer: $4000\n\nIn this case, the customer has to make a purchase of at least $1000 to meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer reaches $5,000 in spending, they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n\n4. Trackers\n\nA tracker is a tool used to track custom values over a specific period and set it as an eligibility criterion for upgrading the tier. Custom values can include bill amount, gross bill amount, points, line item price, and number of customer visits to the store.\n\nUp to three trackers can be defined for a tier upgrade.\n\nRefer to the documentation on trackers for more information.\n\nNote:\n\nWhen a tier program is updated to include a tracker as an eligibility criterion, the tracker will only track the customer’s previous custom values for tier upgrades. For tier downgrades and renewals, the tracker will start monitoring custom values from the date it was configured in the tier program.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nEligibility criteria: number of customer visits to the store >4\n\nTracking period: 12 months\n\nThe number of times the customer has visited the store in the last 10 months: 4\n\nIn this case, the customer must visit the store again in the next two months to meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer visits the store and makes a purchase, the customer is upgraded to a higher tier.\n\nIf the customer returns their transaction made on the fifth visit, the value will be reduced to four visits. Consequently, the tier upgrade will be reversed, and the customer will be downgraded to the previous tier.\n\nCreating upgrade criteria\n\nYou can create dynamic upgrade criteria for tier upgrades by combining multiple criteria. You can define up to three eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade.\n\nThree types of logical operations can be placed between these criteria depending on the use case:\n\n1. Any (N-1) condition\n\nThe Any (N-1) operation can define the number of conditions required to qualify for a tier upgrade. When this operation is applied, the customer must meet the specified number of criteria to qualify for a tier upgrade.\n\nFor example, assume there are 4 conditions/criteria defined in the eligibility criteria of the tier. Now, when the \"ANY\" is selected, the brand will have the following options:\n\nANY 1 This is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 4 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\n\nThis is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 4 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\n\nANY 2 Among the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\n\nAmong the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\n\nANY 3 Among the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\n\nAmong the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\n\nNote: As per the above example, there is no \"ANY 4\". This is because, if the user has to follow all the 4 conditions that are present, then it is like \"ALL 4\". That is why, the ANY will have values till (N-1).\n\nTo understand more about this, refer to the following example: Any condition example section .\n\n2. All condition\n\nIf all the criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a tier upgrade, the All condition can be used. When an All condition is applied, the customer must meet all of specified criteria to qualify for a tier upgrade.\n\nRefer to the All condition example section for more information.\n\nNote\n\nFor an Any condition, the upgrade type must be the same for all criteria. Selecting multiple upgrade types is not supported.\n\nThis is primarily because, if different upgrade types are used in different conditions, in the event of success there is no way for the system to know \"which condition's upgrade\" criteria it should follow.\n\nRefer to the types of tier upgrades for more information.\n\n3. Custom condition\n\nCustom conditions allow you to create a combination of Any and All conditions and define a custom expression for the eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade.\n\nRefer to the custom condition example section for more information.\n\nCustomer tracker with the condition (A AND B) OR C\n\nImportant\n\nAll expressions are evaluated from left to right. E.g.: The expression A OR B AND C is read as (A OR B) AND C as it is evaluated from left to right.\n\nIt is recommended to use parentheses () and define the operators in full ( AND or OR ) or as ( && or || ) when defining expressions to avoid ambiguity and ensure successful validation.\n\nUsing a single & or | is invalid and unsupported.\n\nExamples of tier upgrades\n\n1. Any (N-1) condition\n\nA brand has a travel rewards program that rewards customers and rewards a Platinum status for its most loyal customers. Platinum customers receive extra perks, such as larger discounts and access to premium partner hotels.\n\nThe criteria for reaching Platinum status are as follows:\n\nEarn 1500 lifetime points by using the brand's services\n\nTake 5 flights in the last 12 months\n\nStay in 3 partner hotels in the last 12 months\n\nThe brand has set an Any 1 condition for the tier upgrade.

There are three tiers in the program: Pro, Elite and Ultimate. The Ultimate tier has the most perks: six free fitness classes per month and access to personal trainers.\n\nThe criteria for reaching the Ultimate tier are as follows:\n\nAccumulate 2000 current points\n\nWorkout at least 15 times in the last 3 months\n\nPurchase gym accessories worth $500 in the last 3 months\n\nThe brand has set an All condition for the tier upgrade.

In this case, the customer receives the benefits of the Gold tier, which amounts to 20% of $2000, that is 400 points, and is then upgraded to the Diamond tier.\n\nUpgrade to the next tier and then issue points (Eager): Upgrade the tier first, then award points based on the new tier. In this case, the customer is upgraded to the Diamond tier and is then rewarded with points equal to 30% of $2000 that is 600 points.\n\nIssue points, upgrade tier, and then issue remaining points (Dynamic): Award points for the portion of the transaction that qualifies for the current tier, then upgrade the tier and award points for the remaining transaction amount. In this case, the customer earns 200 points for the initial $1000 transaction and then advances to the Diamond tier. Afterward, within the Diamond tier, the customer earns the remaining 300 points for the additional $1000 transaction amount.\n\nImpact on tier upgrades on returning a transaction\n\nIf a customer returns a transaction that resulted in a tier upgrade, the upgrade will be reversed, and the customer will be downgraded to the previous eligible tier.\n\nUpdated 3 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/tier-downgrade-renewal", "title": "Tier Renewal & Downgrade", "text": "Tier Renewal & Downgrade\n\nTier renewal is the process of renewing a customer’s current tier for an additional period.  A renewal check is executed based on the expiration of the tier validity period, and if the conditions are satisfied, the customer qualifies for a tier renewal. Refer to configuring tier validity for more information.\n\nIf a customer does not qualify for a tier renewal they will be downgraded to a lower tier. Refer to configuring tier downgrade for more information.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore configuring the eligibility criteria for a tier renewal, ensure the following are met:\n\nConfigure a loyalty program\n\nCreate the tiers\n\nCreate the trackers\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nA customer can receive a tier renewal by meeting any of the eligibility criteria set in the program. The following are the criteria available for a tier renewal:\n\n1. Purchase\n\nPurchases are the total amount a customer has spent throughout the tier validity period. The customer must meet a certain threshold of purchases set by the loyalty program to qualify for a tier renewal.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nRenewal eligibility for the tier: $5000\n\nTotal purchases of the customer: $4000\n\nIn this case, the customer has to make a purchase of at least $1000 to  qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach $5,000 in spending before the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n\n2. Number of visits\n\nNumber of visits is the total number of times a customer has visited the store throughout the tier validity period. The customer must meet a certain number of visits set by the loyalty program to qualify for a tier renewal.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nRenewal eligibility for the tier: 10 store visits\n\nTotal visits of the customer: 8 store visits\n\nIn this case, the customer has to visit the store at least two more times to qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach ten store visits before the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n\n3. Points earned\n\nPoints are the total points a customer has earned throughout the tier validity period. These include active, expired, and redeemed points. The customer must meet a certain threshold of points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the renewal.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nRenewal eligibility for the tier: 5000 points\n\nTotal points customer earned: 3500 points\n\nIn this case, the customer must earn 1500 more points to qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach 5000 points before the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n\n4. Trackers\n\nA tracker is a tool used to track custom values over a specific period and set it as an eligibility criterion for renewing the tier. Custom values can include bill amount, gross bill amount, points, line item price, and number of customer visits to the store.\n\nUp to 3 trackers can be defined for a tier renewal.\n\nRefer to the documentation on trackers for more information.\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nRenewal eligibility for the tier: 10 flights\n\nTotal flights taken by customer: 8 flights\n\nIn this case. the customer must take two more flights to qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach ten flights before the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n\nCreating dynamic renewal criteria\n\nYou can create dynamic criteria for tier renewal by combining multiple criteria. You can define up to three separate eligibility criteria for a tier renewal.\n\nThere are three types of conditions you can set to define the renewal criteria:\n\n1. Any (N-1) condition\n\nThe Any (N-1) operation can define the number of conditions required to qualify for a tier renewal. When this operation is applied, the customer must meet the specified number of criteria to qualify for a tier renewal.\n\nFor example, assume there are 5 conditions/criteria defined in the renewal criteria of the tier. Now, when the \"ANY\" is selected, the brand will have the following options:\n\nANY 1 This is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 5 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\n\nThis is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 5 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\n\nANY 2 Among the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\n\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\n\nANY 3 Among the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\n\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\n\nANY 4 Among the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 4 conditions.\n\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 4 conditions.\n\nNote : As per the above example, there is no \"ANY 5\". This is because, if the user has to follow all the 5 conditions that are present, then it is like \"ALL 5\". That is why, the ANY will have values till (N-1).\n\nRefer to the Any condition example section for more information.\n\n2. All condition\n\nIf all the criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a tier renewal, the All condition can be used. When an All condition is applied, the customer must meet all of specified criteria to qualify for a tier renewal.\n\nRefer to the All condition example section for more information.\n\n3. Custom condition\n\nCustom conditions allow you to create a combination of Any and All conditions and define a custom expression for the eligibility criteria for a tier renewal.\n\nRefer to the custom condition example section for more information.\n\nTracker with condition (A AND B) OR C\n\nImportant\n\nAll expressions are evaluated from left to right. E.g.: the expression A OR B AND C is read as (A OR B) AND C as it is evaluated from left to right.\n\nIt is recommended to use parentheses () and define the operators in full ( AND or OR ) or as ( && or || ) when defining expressions to avoid ambiguity and ensure successful validation.\n\nUsing a single & or | is invalid and unsupported.\n\nExamples for tier renewal\n\n1. Any (N-1) condition\n\nA restaurant has a loyalty program that rewards frequent diners with the Gourmet tier, which includes perks like complimentary appetizers and priority seating.\n\nThe renewal criteria for the Gourmet tier are as follows:\n\nSpend a total of $1500 on dining\n\nVisit the restaurant at least 10 times\n\nPurchase at least 5 different menu items\n\nThe brand has set an Any 1 condition for the tier renewal. This means that if a customer meets any one of the above criteria when their Gourmet tier is about to expire, their tier will be renewed.\n\nTo create an Any condition tier renewal criteria, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to Home > Loyalty+ from the InTouch portal.\n\nNavigate to Home > Loyalty+ from the InTouch portal.\n\nCreate or edit an existing loyalty program and create the tiers if required.\n\nCreate or edit an existing loyalty program and create the tiers if required.\n\nCreate and configure all the required criteria trackers.

One tier below\n\nThe customer is downgraded to a tier lower than their current tier. If the customer is in the base tier, they will remain in the same tier.\n\n2. An appropriate tier based on eligibility\n\nThe customer is downgraded to a tier that matches their current points.\n\nFor example\n\nConsider the below case:\n\nThe renew criterion for the third tier is 1000 current points at the time of tier expiry.\n\nPoints the customer holds: 500 current points\n\nThe eligibility criteria for the first tier: 500 current points\n\nSince the customer currently has 500 points at the time of the tier expiry, they do not qualify for a tier renewal and will be downgraded to the eligible tier, that is the first tier.\n\n3.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points", "title": "Points", "text": "Points\n\nYou can define conditions for earning points, redeeming points, expiry of points and returning points.\n\nOverview\n\nEarn conditions allow an org to create various conditions and define how a customer can earn points. You can have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.\n\nNote\n\nFor MLP enabled orgs , allocation strategies created in a program are associated only with that program and cannot be used even in the org's default program.\n\nCapillary does not support converting already allocated redeemable points to non-redeemable points. If you need to remove or suppress redeemable points after allocation (for example, due to double allocation or error), you can use the Manual Points Adjustment UI / API .\n\nConfigure points delay accrual\n\nDelayed accrual allows issuing points to customer for an activity at a later date. For example, if you support item returns, say for a week from the purchase date, you can actually block customers from using those points before the return period. This avoids redundancy and fraud activities.\n\nIn Delayed Accrual, points are first issued as promised points. These cannot be redeemed by the customer. After the configured period, these points are converted and credited to the main balance.\n\nIn Delayed Accrual, the points allocation date is when points are actually issued to the customer. In the case of Delayed Accrual, the awarded date is when points get added to the current points (accrued date). Refer to the following examples for clarity.\n\nIf a transaction with bill date A is sent to Loyalty EMF on date B, the awarded date is date B.\n\nIf the transactionAdd activity of date A gets replayed on date B, the awarded date is date B.\n\nIf bill points with bill date A are imported on date B, the awarded date is date B.\n\nThe 'delayed accrual points' are added to the 'current points' on the next morning of the delay period, i.e., (event date + the number of days of delay) specified in the point allocation strategy.\n\nIf a transaction is added on 28th Sep and the number of days of delay is 1, the delayed accrual points will get added to current points on the morning of 30th Sep (morning after 28, Sep + 1 day). The awarded date is 30 Sep.\n\nYou can create rules on the points that are redeemable, non-redeemable, or with the summation of both.\n\nFind the details of event, action, and limitations of Delayed Accrual below -\n\nEvent name : DelayedAccrual. You need to configure the DelayedAccrual activity to perform actions on Delayed Accrual.\n\nAction : To enable converting promised points to current points, for the DelayedAccrual activity, you need to set Delayed Accrual Action .\n\nOther actions supported :\n\nSend Messages (SMS, Email, Mobile Push)\n\nUpgrade To Tier\n\nIssue Coupon\n\nDelayed Accrual\n\nLimitations :\n\nFor an activity, you cannot use both direct allocation and delayed accrual strategies. You cannot have strategies with different delay periods. For example, you cannot use one strategy with 4 days delay period and another strategy with 7 days delay period.\n\nYou cannot use Delayed Accrual strategies on Registration and Customer Update activities.\n\nPoints unlock ability\n\nBy now, it is very clear that brands can give delayed points to their customers from our Loyalty settings (delayed accrual strategy). However, some times brands might want to convert these delayed points also as redeemable points for their customers.\n\nThe only way available to do this is via external triggers. Till now, we have this ability only for bill level. But now, we have the ability to do this even on line item levels.\n\nSome sample use cases:\n\nAs a system integrator, I would like to be able to to configure fixed return windows for different line items, allocate promised points on each line item and convert them to redeemable points according to each line item’s return window, so that the users can get regular points on each line item, as and when the return window for the line items gets over and don't have to wait for the default return windows to get over.\n\nAs a Loyalty Program Manager, I would like to be able to give my customer an option to end the return window for any transaction or any line item in the transaction and immediately convert promised points to regular points.\n\nYou can find more information on how to use this API at below link, please refer.\n\nPoints Unlock API\n\nConfigure points earn conditions\n\nThere are three allocation types available.\n\nFixed : A fixed number of points is allocated irrespective of the transaction amount.\n\nRound Up : Points are awarded for the gap amount within a defined range. This type can only be used inside Engage+.\n\nProrated : Points are issued as a percentage of the transaction amount or custom field value and through step function.\n\nBased on the chosen allocation type, you can have the following combinations of points allocation strategies.\n\nReward points as a percentage of a transaction amount with the same percentage across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15%, Tier2: 15%.\n\nReward points as a percentage of the transaction amount with different percentages for each tier. For example - Tier1: 15% of the transaction amount, Tier2: 20% of the transaction amount.\n\nReward a fixed number of points per transaction across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.\n\nReward a fixed number of points per transaction with different values across tiers. For example - Tier1: 10 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.\nTo configure earning conditions, do the following.\n\nReward a fixed number of points in equal step sizes or transaction intervals. For example, allocate 10 points on every spend of Rs.200. So a person doing a transaction of 450 will get 20 points, because his transaction amount lies between 400 - 600.\n\nOn Intouch , navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nIn Programs , select the program you want to edit.\n\nClick Edit Program .\n\nClick Points .\n\nClick Add Earn Conditions .\n\nIn Name , enter the condition name.\n\nIn Description , describe the condition.\n\nIn Module Using this Condition , select the module Loyalty or Engage where you want to use this condition.\n\nNote\n\nIf you select Campaigns, three options are available: Fixed , Round Up , and Prorate .\n\nIn Allocate Based On , select your preferred option, based on which the points are allocated.\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nTiers\n\nThis is the default option. Points are allocated to customers according to their tiers.\n\nLoyalty Registration\n\nPoints are allocated to customers based on the information they provide during the registration. You can select any one of the custom fields.\n\nFor example, if you select an age group of 25-30, points are allocated to customers belonging to this exact age group.\n\nLoyalty Transaction\n\nPoints are allocated to customers on the basis of their Loyalty transaction. For example, if you select order_channel, points are awarded only to customers who made a transaction through a particular channel(For example- Instore).\n\nIn Allocation Type , select your preferred allocation type to define the criteria for giving points to customers.\n\nType\n\nModule\n\nDescription\n\nFixed\n\nLoyalty & Engage\n\nReward a fixed number of points (irrespective of the transaction amount).\n\nFor example: 10 to issue 10 points per transaction\n\nRound up\n\nEngage\n\nReward customers with points to round their balance up to the nearest multiple of a defined value within a specified range.\n\nFor example, if the points range is from 0-1000 and the round upto value is 10, a customer with 643 points will recieve 7 points, bringing their total balance to 650.\n\nProrated- in terms of %\n\nLoyalty\n\nReward points as a percentage of the transaction amount.\n\nFor example: 10 to issue 50 points if the transaction amount is 500.\n\nPoints Multiplier- in terms of %\n\nLoyalty\n\nReward extra points to the customers along with the existing points. This is used in promotion (run with a shorter period) along with the existing allocation strategy.\n\nFor example: If an org issues 10 points to the customers in the lowest tier, during Diwali season the org can issue 10x points to attract more customers in the lowest tier to make more purchases with the org. The customers will receive 100 points (10 multiplied by 10) if they make a transaction with org during Diwali season.\n\nProrate - In terms of step function\n\nLoyalty & Engage\n\nReward a fixed number of points for equal transaction intervals or steps.\n\nFor example: Allocate 5 points on every transaction of $150. This way, a transaction amount lying between $0-150 gets 5 points, and transactions between 151-300 get 10 points and so on.\n\nEnable Same for all Tiers and enter the point value.\nThe point value will be the same for all the tiers in the program, If disabled, you can enter different point values for different tiers.\n\nIn Enable Delayed Accrual , enable the checkbox and enter the days after which the customer is able to redeem points.\n\nDELAYED ACCRUAL : Points are reflected in the customer's account immediately after the transaction but are only redeemable after the prescribed number of days. For example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected in the customer's account right after the purchase, but if the customer decides to return the shirt on the third day, the points will disappear from the account and the customer is unable to use the acquired points. Delayed accrual prevents customers from misusing points.\n\nClick Done .\n\nAllocate points on custom field values\n\nYou can also reward points to your customers based on the custom field values that are submitted on the customer registration and profile update screens of InStore.  This works only for the custom fields with integer values (example: 20) and not for string values (example: John). It is recommended to use a fixed points allocation type for custom fields.\n\nTo configure rewarding points based on the custom fields, do the following:\n\nIn Earn conditions click Add earn condition to create a new point earning condition (or) to modify an existing condition, navigate to the earn condition and click the respective edit button.\n\nIn Allocate based on, choose either Loyalty Registration or Loyalty Transaction and select your desired custom field accordingly.\n\nIn the Allocation type , choose Fixed to allocate a specific number of points for every transaction (irrespective of the transaction amount). Choose Prorated to allocate points as a percentage of the transaction amount.\n\nClick Done .\n\nConfigure points round-up for campaigns\n\nEarn condition configuration for Campaigns has an additional Allocation type - Round up. This lets you round up points that are in a specific range for each tier. For example, when running campaigns, you can round up points that are between 30-100 to 100 for all customers in the base tier.\n\nIf Same for all Tiers is disabled, Round up configuration will vary for each tier.\n\nIn Allocation type , choose Roundup .\n\nIn Points range , configure from, to, and round up to the range of points and the value that you want to have for the roundup. For example, if a customer has 40 points (current points) in his/her account and when the campaign is triggered, an additional 60 points will be added to his/her account making it 100 as configured.\n\nConfigure rules for points allocation strategy\n\nOnce you create a strategy, you need to configure the relevant activity and define rules based on which you want to execute specific points earning conditions.\nAllocation Points is an action that allows you to award points to customers based on certain activities (registration, transaction, profile update, coupon redemption, points redemption, tier upgrade).\n\nTo configure Rules for Points Allocation :\n\nIn Workflow , go to Customer Activity and click TransactionAdd.\n\nIn Select Customer Activity , choose the activity for which you want to define earn condition rules. While defining actions, you can choose the desired allocation strategy in Earn Condition as shown.\n\nYou can also set up notifications to send to customers on the successful execution of the activity. Configure SMS, email, WeChat, and/or Mobile Push templates accordingly.\n\nConfigure customer activity for points allocation at the transaction item level\n\nTo allocate points at the transaction item level, you need to have a forward case in which the transaction item is enabled. To issue points on a transaction item based on the item price enable Use proportions .\n\nTransaction item is available only for forward cases (Forward to set action).\n\nUse proportions and Maximize point allocation options are visible only after you enable Enable transaction item .\n\nEnable transaction item : Enable this option to issue points at the line-item level.\n\nUse proportions : Enable this option to split points according to the price of transaction items. For example, consider a transaction with a bill amount of $300 consisting of two line items lineitem1 of $100, and lineitem2 of $200. If points allocation is 10% of the transaction amount, then 10 points will be issued for lineitem1 and 20 for lineitem2.\n\nMaximize point allocation : Enable this option to set a cap on points allocated to customers.\n\nEnable tender unroller : Enable this option to configure rules on payment modes.\n\nLimit points issual per customer for each set\n\nYou can limit points issued to customers on transaction amount, line-item amount, and tracker value for each set and subset separately per customer.\n\nAfter adding and deleting the capping value, click Save .\n\nThe following are the different capping configurations supported.\n\nTotal Points capping: Limit the maximum amount of points allocated to a customer across all actions inside a set and all its subsets. This is applicable for all sets of the TransactionAdd customer activity.\n\nTo limit total points per customer for a condition in the TransactionAdd customer activity, do the following.\n\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity. Click +Add capping.\n\nIn Add capping page, click Total points.\n\nIn Total points, set the limit per customer.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSource value capping\nSet a limit on the value based on which points are calculated and awarded to customers. For example, if there is x% discount on bill amount and source value is set as 5000, the customer receives x% on bill amount or x% on 5000 as points (whichever is lower). This is applicable for Set1 and its subsets of the TransactionAdd customer activity.\n\nTo limit points per customer for a condition in the TransactionAdd customer activity.\n\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity. Click +Add capping.\n\nIn Add capping page, click Source value.\n\nIn Source value, set the limit per customer.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSum of tender amounts\nThis option lets you limit points based on eligible payment methods.

For example, if a customer buys a shirt on June 10, 2021, then the validity period for points for this customer can be set on any day after this transaction was made.\n\nRolling Expiry from Event Date\n\nThe current date of points expiry is reset to a new date based on the recent transaction date. That is, if a customer earns points before the expiry of existing points, the validity of all points will reset to the new points expiry date.\nFor example, if a customer who made a transaction on June 10, 2021, has their point expiring on July 10, 2021, but they again made a transaction on July 7, 2021, then customers’ existing points along with the newly acquired point will have a new validity period, based on the transaction made on July 7, 2021.\nNote: Only the points that were issued via rolling strategies are extended.\n\nMembership Event Date\n\nPoints expire automatically when the membership expires. This is usually used for membership-based loyalty. For example, if a customer has subscribed to a Platinum membership with a Digital store, and has his/her membership expiring in January 2022, then the points earned by this customer also expire in January 2022.\n\nCustomer's registration date\n\nPoints will expire on the registration date of the customer.

The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.\nIf the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.\n\nNote: * As this is a transaction-extended field where the value of the field will be coming via a transaction this is available only for the loyalty module when creating the expiry strategy.\n\nCustomer extended field\n\nPoints expire based on the date in the selected customer-extended field. This capability supports time units (days, months). The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.\nIf the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.\n\nNote: * As this customer-extended field is independent of the transaction, it is available in both the loyalty and engage modules when creating the expiry strategy.\n\nEnable Same for all Tiers.\nIn Time Unit, select your preferred option to set the validity period for points.\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nDays\n\nPoints expire after the configured number of days.\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 1, 2021, and the Days for expiry is set as 10, points will expire on July 11, 2021.\n\nMonths\n\nPoints expire after the configured number of months.\nNOTE: Points will expire only on the last day of the month,\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 10, 2021, and Months for expiry is set as 1, points will expire on August 31, 2021.\n\nDate\n\nPoints expire on the configured date.\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on June 1, 2021, and the Date for expiry is set as August 10, 2021, then points will expire on this fixed date only.\n\nNever\n\nPoints will never expire for the customer.\n\nIn Expire Pts. at the end of, enter the days or number of months for points to expire.\nFor Date, you have to select a date on which points expire. For Never, there is no configuration required.\n\nClick Done.\n\nCreate redeem conditions\n\nRedeem conditions allow you to configure points conversion ratio, eligibility criteria, and limit for points redemption. The eligibility criteria could be current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases.\n\nYou can configure points redemption to do the following.\n\nSet-point conversion ratio\n\nDefine the minimum points a customer should earn.\n\nLimit the number of points redemption per transaction.\n\nRedeem points in multiples of 'X'.\n\nCustomers need at least 150-lifetime points to be eligible for redeeming points\n\nRedemption is allowed only in multiples of 50, and\n\nA maximum of 100 points can be redeemed per transaction\n\nAt least one redemption strategy should be created in a loyalty program. An error is shown if you run the loyalty program without any points redemption strategy.\n\nFor MLP, points redemption strategies created in a program cannot be used in other org programs, not even in the org's default program.\n\nTo configure redeem conditions, do the following -\n\nOn Intouch , navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nIn Programs , select the program you want to edit.\n\nClick Edit Program\n\nClick Points .\n\nIn How much is each point worth? , specify the points conversion ratio (in terms of org's base currency).

This is applicable for issued points , returned points , re-evaluated points , delayed accrual points , line-item allocation, issued and re-evaluated points on line items, manual points adjustments and points redemption .\n\nFor example, 50.3458 points have to be issued to a customer. The following table highlights the points that will be issued based on the round off setting configured. The rounding strategy is round half-up (default).\n\nTo configure points round-of settings, follow these steps:\n\nOn Intouch , navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nIn Programs , select the program for which you want to set the points round-off setting and click Edit Program > Advanced settings .\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nChoose the decimal places using the drop-down list under Round off decimal earnings by .

By default, the system stores the values up to 3 decimal places.\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nReward currency rounding strategy\n\nYou can define the strategy for rounding off reward currencies. Based on the number of decimals configured, the rounding is considered up to those decimal places. For example, if the round-off is set to two decimal places, the rounding would be for the nearest hundredths.\n\nThe types of strategies for rounding are as follows:\n\nCeiling : Rounds numbers towards positive infinity. Positive numbers round-up, while negative numbers round down (towards zero).\n\nFloor : Rounds numbers towards negative infinity. Positive numbers round down, while negative numbers round down.\n\nRound Half Up : Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded up.\n\nRound Half Down : Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded down.\n\nRound Half Even : Rounds to the nearest value, rounding to the nearest even number when the next digit is exactly five.\n\nFor example, 25.8751 points are to be allocated to a customer and the round-off is set to two decimal places, The following table highlights the value of points that will be issued based on the round off strategy:\n\nTo configure the points round-of strategy, follow these steps:\n\nOn Intouch , navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nIn Programs , select the program for which you want to set the points round-off setting and click Edit Program > Advanced settings .\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nChoose the points rounding strategy using the drop-down list under Currency rounding strategy for decimal conversion . that appears on the earn conditions.

By default, the system rounds half up.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nRolling points expiry when no points are issued\n\nPoints rolling expiry is a feature that resets or extends the expiry date of loyalty points when a customer performs certain actions, such as making a transaction or redeeming points. Refer to the documentation for more information on points rolling expiry .\n\nBy default, the rolling expiry process only considers points with a value greater than zero. If a customer performs a rolling event and receives no points for it, the system will not consider the rolling event even if it is valid, and the expiry window is not extended. To consider rolling when no points are earned, you can enable Roll the expiry even when 0 points are given to ensure that it is considered for extending the expiry.\n\nFor example:\nA retail loyalty program configures points earned to expire after 12 months unless they engage in a rolling event to extend the expiry.\n\nA customer earns 100 points in January 2024, with a 12-month rolling expiry (set to expire in January 2025).\n\nNow, in December 2024, the customer purchases as part of a special promotion. However, this promotion does not award any new points (zero points are awarded).\n\nWhen disabled:\n\nSince the promotion awards zero points, it is ignored by the rolling expiry.\n\nThe customer’s 100 points still expire in January 2025 .\n\nWhen enabled:\n\nThe system recognizes the zero-point award purchase as a valid rolling event .\n\nThe system recognizes the zero-point award purchase as a valid rolling event .\n\nThe expiry date of the 100 points is extended to December 2025 .\n\nThe expiry date of the 100 points is extended to December 2025 .\n\nTo enable rolling points expiry when no points are issued, follow these steps:\n\nOn Intouch, navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nOn Intouch, navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nSelect your program, then choose Edit Program > Advanced settings .\n\nSelect your program, then choose Edit Program > Advanced settings .\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nNavigate to the Points page.\n\nTurn on the Roll expiry even when 0 points are given toggle.\n\nTurn on the Roll expiry even when 0 points are given toggle.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I limit the number of times my customer can earn points? You can limit the number of points a customer can earn in the points earning condition. However, there is no option to limit the number of times the points are issued for a customer.\n\nWhat is the use of proportion and max point allocation? Use Proportion lets you issue points based on the line item amount. The Maximum points allocation is to set a threshold value for the number of points a customer can earn.\n\nHow is the Transaction Points Allocation action different from Allocate Points? Transactional Points - Points you earn as per the configured ruleset for making a transaction.\n\nAllocate Points - Points you can assign on the transaction amount and custom field values based on the configured ruleset.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago"}

For example, if a customer's tier is to be renewed on June 15, 2021, and you configure Alert 7 Days before Renewal Check , then customers will receive an alert on June 8, 2021.\n\nAlert Immediately after Renewal\n\nCustomers receive an alert immediately after their tier is renewed.\n\nAlert Immediately after Downgrade\n\nCustomers receive an alert immediately after they are downgraded to a lower tier.\n\nPoints Expiry\n\nTo define communication for when points get expired for each tier, do the following.\n\nIn Alert , enter the number of days before the customer is alerted about tier downgrade.\n\nIf there are no renewal conditions set up, then renewal/downgrade reminder messages will NOT be sent out.\n\nIn Only when the following criteria are true , enable your preferred option and enter the desired value.\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nCumulative Points\n\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their lifetime points are greater than the configured value.\n\nPurchases\n\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their lifetime purchases are greater than the configured value.\n\nCurrent points\n\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their current points are greater than the configured value.\n\nExpiry Points\n\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their expiry points are greater than the configured value.\n\nIn And belongs to any of these tiers , enable the desired tier(s).\n\nClick Save & Continue .\n\nCustomers belonging to the enabled tier(s) will only receive the alert message.\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nThese settings help increase productivity by reaching out to customers based on your org's preferred channel (mandatory) and other channels based on customers'  availability in the order of priority. This can also minimize the cost of communication by reaching out to cheap communication channels and maximize the probability of conversion by prioritizing channels that could give better ROI.\n\nTo configure communication settings, follow these steps.\n\nOn Intouch , navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs .\n\nIn Programs, select the program for which you want to set the communication setting and click Edit Program > Advanced settings .\n\nIn the Communication Channels , enable the Setup Communication toggle button to set mandatory channels and priority channels.\n\nMandatory Channels : Channels that are mandatory for sending the notifications Priority Channels : Channels that need to be triggered based on priority and availability. For example, if Mobile is set as priority 1, Mobile Push as priority 2, and email as priority 3, the system first checks whether SMS is configured and then checks if the mobile number is available for the customer. If anyone fails, then it will try to send the notification through mobile push and so on.\n\nFor example, consider for a tier upgrade event, SMS is set as a Mandatory Channel and the priority channels are eMail (1) and WeChat (2). When a tier is upgraded for the customers mentioned in the following table, notifications are sent based on the channel availability and configuration settings as explained below.\n\nChannel\n\nSMS\n\neMail\n\nWeChat\n\nCustomer A\n\nMa\n\nEa\n\nWa\n\nCustomer B\n\nMb\n\nWb\n\nCustomer C\n\nEc\n\nCustomer A will get an SMS on Ma and an eMail on Ea.\n\nCustomer B will get an SMS on Mb and a WeChat message on Wb.\n\nCustomer C will not get an SMS and gets an eMail on Ec.\n\nClick Done.\n\nChannels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.\n\nFor notifications configured for external sources such as Facebook, if a specific channel is not available for a customer, then the notification is sent through identifiers available in internal sources (such as mobile no. and WeChat). For example, consider that an org (that is in both internal and external channels) wants to send an SMS for a Facebook event. Based on the channel availability on a customer's Facebook account, notifications are sent as explained in the following.\n\nSource\n\nFacebook (External)\n\nEcrm (Internal)\n\nCustomer A\n\nMaf\n\nMae\n\nCustomer B\n\nMbf\n\nCustomer C\n\nMce\n\nIf an SMS notification is sent for a Facebook event:\n\nCustomer A gets a message on mobile Maf.\n\nCustomer B gets a message on mobile Mbf.\n\nCustomer C gets a message on mobile Mce.\n\nIf an SMS is sent for an eCRM event:\n\nCustomer A gets a message on mobile Mae.\n\nCustomer B won’t get any message.\n\nCustomer C gets a message on mobile Mce.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

The last parent set is for the transaction finished activity.\n\nWhen a transaction is made, the first set is invoked and forwards to the second set. The second set validates all the trackers and executes actions based on the rules and actions configured. The event then gets forwarded to the third set which completes the transaction event.\n\nOn the EventsView page, choose TransactionAdd event and navigate to TrackerSet.\n\nClick +Condition .\n\nLeave Expression and Expression equals to true.\n\nIn the When field, click + and select the default Forward to Set action using **+Add action **> Click Save > Enable transaction item > Click Save .\n\nA new tracker is created under the TrackerSet as shown above.

The total points issued to a customer can be limited from based on the transaction value and payment method.\n\nNote\n\nThe limiting of points is only applicable for the **TransactionAdd** customer activity.\n\nTo configure points capping, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to a loyalty program and select Edit Program\n\nNavigate to the Workflows section.\n\nSelect TransactionAdd under the Customer Activity section.\n\nChoose the ruleset and select Reward currency limit .\n\nSelect the capping type and enter the capping values.\n\nThe types of capping are as follows:\n\nSelect Save to confirm the changes.\n\nSelect Save to confirm the changes.\n\nSelect Save and Continue to save the changes.\n\nSelect Save and Continue to save the changes.\n\nNotes\n\nLimiting points based on the payment method is supported for the Evaluation Start ruleset.\n\nFor advanced capping configurations, refer to documentation on advanced capping .\n\nConfigure Rulesets\n\nThe sets are categorized for better understanding. There are four categories in the TransactionAdd event and one in remaining customer activities. Evaluation Start : The evaluation of the event or activity will start from the sets within this category. This set processes each record or line item in the event and executes various actions such as points allocation, issuing a coupon to the customer, enrolling the customer in subscriptions, sending a message, or upgrading the tier of the customer. Trackers : The trackers created in the program will be evaluated here. In this set, brands can award points or execute the mentioned actions by tracking the event and its attributes within a specific window To evaluate the trackers add “forward to set” actions and select the trackers to be evaluated. Points trackers: Once a points tracker is created, it is always available for rule writing in the above sets. The linking of the points tracker here upgrades the customer based on defined points tracker values. All points of a customer are tracked irrespective of the rules written here. Evaluation end: This set is designed to execute follow-up actions after the successful processing of the above events, such as sending SMS or email notifications since you want to send them once only. It allows for various additional actions to be performed. However, be mindful that points allocation and other related actions should be completed in the previous sets to ensure the accurate inclusion of tags in your messages.\n\nWhen the event scope is set, navigate to the condition pane to create rules and define actions to be executed. You can create multiple conditions using + Condition in the All Conditions pane.\n\nClick on Condition to add a new condition to the rule. A condition is a combination of rule expression, expression validation (When), and action (executed based on the expression value). Refer to the following steps to define a condition.\n\nIn the Expression box, write the condition to evaluate. See the supported Profiles for each event and the relevant profile attributes and operators used in rule expressions. Also, see the section below on writing rules to better understand how to do it.\n\nClick + When and choose the expression result ( Expression is True or False) and set the action to be executed. You can set actions either for success case or for failure case, i.e., you can set actions to be executed either for expression result true or for false.\n\nExpression is : Set when to execute the action - when the result of the expression is satisfied (True) or not satisfied (False).\n\nIf you want to execute rules as per your loyalty program configuration, specify 'true' in the expression box and Expression equals box. Then, select the action to be performed.\n\n+ Action : Click to show the supported actions and select the action to be performed for the given condition.\n\nBased on the selected action, you will see some relevant options that need to be configured. Here, you can create a new strategy (by clicking New ) or choose the existing strategies. for example, to choose the points allocation strategy you want to apply for the program.\n\nClick on any selected Action to set up channel notifications using different channels. For example, in the following example clicking Allocation Points allows you to configure mandatory or priority channels for the allocation points action.\n\nChannels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.\n\nClick Save to save the changes made in the loyalty program.\n\nClick Publish Changes to apply changes to the loyalty program.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/auto-points-conversion-to-reward", "title": "Auto points conversion to reward", "text": "Auto points conversion to reward\n\nNew Customer Activity : Auto points conversion to reward\n\nOverview\n\nThe new customer activity, i.e. \"Auto Points conversion to reward,\" enables the functionality of automatic consumptions of a threshold number of points and awarding the customer with a reward configured within the workflow.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the US market, it is a common practice to convert the points of a customer to a coupon on a certain threshold.\n\nExample: When the user purchases and gets 200 points, the points should be deducted from the user account and they will get a $10 off coupon code and when they reach 400 points, they will get a 2X $10 off coupon code. But when the user gets 450 points in a transaction, only 400 points should be detected and issue 2X $10 off coupon code, the rest 50 points will not be deducted.\n\nWhy auto-convert points to coupons?\n\nAuto-redemption of points into coupons allows brands to manage their point liability in a way other than expiring points, typically in a much quicker fashion than normal. It is very common in the US as brands want to keep their point liabilities as low as possible.\n\nPay with points is considered a premium feature in the US market. Just converting points into rewards and points into a voucher is considered normal.\n\nSimplicity for brand and customers. Brands don't have to deal with redemption of points, or security like OTP, redemption reversal, etc. Customers don't have to manage points and make a lot of decisions to get the same amount of benefit. Saves a lot of operational hassle. Points redemption is one of the top 5 issues that we get on a monthly basis mostly OTP.\n\nHere is the step-by-step guide.\n\nOn Intouch, navigate to Loyalty+ > Programs .

Even if you attend 15, you still get ₹250. Achieved Value : Calculate rewards based on what is accomplished. Example: A customer earns 5% on their total bill. If they buy products worth ₹10,000, they get 500 points. If they buy products worth ₹15,000, 750 points. Achieved Value above Defined Target : Calculate rewards based on how much the target was exceeded. Example: A fitness app sets a monthly goal of 1500 workout minutes. For every 100 minutes beyond the goal, users earn a ₹250 discount on fitness gear. If someone completes 1800 minutes, they get ₹750 off (300 extra minutes ÷ 100 = 3 × ₹250). For Unified Targets: Example: A brand sets three individual targets (₹100 in Men's, ₹100 in Kids', ₹100 in Women's) and an overall target of ₹500. 1. All + Overall Target (Meet all 3 category spends + ₹500 total)\n• Defined : Reward based on overall target (₹500). Example: Spend ₹100 (Men's) + ₹100 (Kids) + ₹300 (Women's) = ₹500 → reward for spending ₹500.\n• Achieved : Reward based on total spend (sum of all). Example: Spend ₹600 → reward for spending ₹600.\n• Overachieved : Reward excess over ₹500. Example: ₹600 – ₹500 = ₹100 → reward for spending ₹100.\n\n2. All Targets (No Overall) (Requires ₹100 in Men's, Kids, Women's)\n• Defined : Fixed reward for meeting all 3.\nExample: ₹100 in all 3 → fixed reward for spending ₹300.\n• Achieved/Overachieved : Not applicable (no partial rewards).\n\n3. Any (n-1) Targets (No Overall) Target: Achieve any 2 of 3 categories\n• Defined : Reward based on number of targets configured (e.g., 3).\nExample: Spend ₹100 in Men's, Kids, and Women's → reward calculated as if all 3 are required.\n• Achieved : Reward based on total targets achieved (e.g., 3).\nExample: Spend ₹200 in all 3 → reward for 3.\n• Overachieved : Reward based on excess beyond the threshold (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). Example: Achieve 3 → reward for 1 extra.\n• Qualifying Value: Reward based on threshold (minimum required).\nExample: Threshold = 2 → reward prorated on 2, even if user achieves 3.\n\nMandatory channels\n\nSelect the mandatory channels for the loyalty promotion if required.

You can allocate points on the transaction amount. You can also have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.\n\nTo configure the Transaction point allocation action, follow these steps.\n\nSelect Transaction point allocation and click Save .\n\nIn the Earn condition , choose the desired condition from the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on + Add Condition .\n\nIn the Zero earn condition , choose an appropriate condition from the drop-down. Note: The configuration for the zero earn condition is not determined by these options and depends on the other configurations explained here .\n\nSelect the Expiry condition from the drop-down menu.\nTo create a new Expiry earn condition from scratch, click + Add condition .\n\nIn Prorate on , choose on what basis you want to issue a percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. If bill amount, choose a current event, if tracker, choose current aggregate or previous aggregate\n\nAmount : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\n\nCurrent aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction. This is disabled in Evaluations start and Evaluation end sets.\n\nPrevious aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction. This is disabled in Evaluations start and Evaluation end sets.\n\nIn the Points rounding strategy , you can choose which points rounding strategy you prefer using from the drop-down list. Points rounding strategy informs how many decimal points to use when allocating points to customers.\n\nActual : Issues the actual number of points as configured in the prorated condition. For example, the customer will receive 19.9 points for the transaction amount of 199, if the points allocation condition is set as 10%.\n\nActual : Issues the actual number of points as configured in the prorated condition. For example, the customer will receive 19.9 points for the transaction amount of 199, if the points allocation condition is set as 10%.\n\nFloor : Evaluate and assign the values without considering the decimal value. For example, assume customers should receive 10% of points for transactions. If a customer has purchased for $199, instead of 19.9 points, the customer will receive 19 points.\n\nFloor : Evaluate and assign the values without considering the decimal value. For example, assume customers should receive 10% of points for transactions. If a customer has purchased for $199, instead of 19.9 points, the customer will receive 19 points.\n\nRound : Determine the number of decimal points you want to support for decimal points. Zero is for no decimal, one is for one, two is for two, and three is for three decimal points.\n\nRound : Determine the number of decimal points you want to support for decimal points. Zero is for no decimal, one is for one, two is for two, and three is for three decimal points.\n\nSelect Delay strategy : Following are the different delayed-accrual (or point conversion strategies) that are currently available for the brands to use.\n\nAs defined in the allocation strategy: Points are assigned based on the conditions defined in the allocation strategy. If no conditions are defined, points will be directly issued as current points.\n\nFixed delay days from item return period: Based on the return period configured against the product, issue the promised points as current points once the return period expires. For example, assume for a transaction with a return period of 7 days, the customer is promised to get 1000 points. These promised points will be converted into current points after 7 days i.e. after the return period is over.\n\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities.\n\nFixed delay days from the line-item extended field: Based on the value of the line-item extended field that is selected in the drop-down. Say, there is a line-item extended field called \"ABC\" & this is selected in the drop-down of \"delay strategy\" during the point allocation action after selecting this delay strategy. Now, say a user made a transaction & the value of this field is arrived as 10. Then the points that are being allocated from that action will have a delayed accrual of 10 days.\n\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities, and the line-item extended field should mandatorily come from the transaction payload.\n\nOn external trigger: Issue points at the event of \"transaction add\" as promised points and convert them at the event of \"transaction update\". For example: In hospitals, promised points will be issued immediately when you make a booking and will be converted into current points when the bill is settled.\n\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities.\n\nBased on the behavioral event attribute : Based on the date that is coming via the attribute of the behavioral event. Assume, there is a behavioral \"ABC\" that has 3 attributes (X, a date type attribute; Y, a customer identifier attribute; Z, a numerical attribute). During the point allocation from a promotion (that is created based on this behavioral event), if the delay strategy is selected as \"Based on the event attribute\", then there will be a drop-down where the attribute should be selected. The following are vital points:\n\nIn the drop-down of \"delay strategy\", only the date type of the attribute of the behavioral event will appear.\n\nUnder the prorate drop-down, only the double-type attributes of the behavioral event will appear.\n\nIf the date coming is a past date as per the event processing date, the conversion will happen on the same day.\n\nThis option will be available only for promotions based on behavioral events.\n\nFollowing are the accrual strategies available for transaction-based activities:\n\nFollowing are the accrual strategies available for behavioral event-based activities:\n\nZero earn condition\n\nIn the Zero-earn condition, points are not allocated in the following cases:\n\nBill Number Prefix: When the bill number starts with a prefix defined in the IGNORE_POINTS_FOR_BILL_NUMBER_STARTS_WITH configuration.\n\nBill Number Prefix: When the bill number starts with a prefix defined in the IGNORE_POINTS_FOR_BILL_NUMBER_STARTS_WITH configuration.\n\nCustomer Label: When the BLOCK_POINTS_ALLOCATION label is set for a customer. You can configure this from Organisation settings > Miscellaneous > Customer Status Configuration .\n\nCustomer Label: When the BLOCK_POINTS_ALLOCATION label is set for a customer. You can configure this from Organisation settings > Miscellaneous > Customer Status Configuration .\n\nNote\n\nNote\n\nIn these cases, the customer tier will be upgraded if eligible, despite no points being allocated.\n\nConfigure communication channel(s)\n\nMandatory channels\n\nHere you can select the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure. Then, configure the message for each channel you select.\n\nPriority channels\n\nHere, you can set the channels through which the communication needs to be sent out based on the priority and availability. For example, if you set the priority in the order SMS, email, and mobile push, the system will first check if the customer's mobile number is available,\n\nIf available, it will send an SMS communication and ignore the rest.\n\nIf not available, it will check whether the customer has an email ID\n\nIf an email ID is available, it sends out an email notification to the customer.\n\nIf not, it will check if the customer is active through mobile push and process the message accordingly.\n\nOnce the priority channels are set, configure the message for each channel.\n\nFor more information on communication channels, see here.\n\nUpgrade to tier\n\nYou can upgrade the tier for the customer based on a tracker value or any specific event value and provide all the privileges of the tier.\n\nTo configure the Upgrade to tier action, follow these steps.\n\nSelect Upgrade to tier and click Save .\n\nAfter you select Upgrade to tier , you will see the following screen.\nHover to Slab to upgrade and choose the desired option from the drop-down.\n\nEnable Advanced options to define the Upgrade tier validity for the action. This defines the duration for the tier upgrade. Once the validity expires, the customer reverts to their previous tier.\n\nSelect the validity type from the Upgrade tier validity drop down.\n\nThe validity types available are as follows:\n\nBased on the selected validity type, select the specific date or duration from the Specific duration or Specific date drop down.\n\nThe specific date or duration available are as follows:\n\nBased on the options selected define the tier expiry: Specific date and Manually : Select the specific date date for tier expiry in under Select specific date manually Specific duration and Manually : Enter the number of days after which the tier will expire under Add specific duration manually . Specific date or Specific duration and As per transaction extended field : Select the transaction extended field under the Select transaction extended field drop down.

Refer to the documentation for more information on extended fields .\n\nWarning\n\nNote\n\nIf you set a tier expiry date that is already in the past , the upgraded tier will expire immediately. The customer will not receive the tier upgrade at all, as the expiry date has already passed.\n\nEnable Award points to enable the criteria to award the points to the customer.\n\nIn the Earn condition , choose the desired condition from the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on + Add Condition .\n\nSelect the Expiry condition from the drop-down menu.\nTo create a new expiry earn condition from scratch, click + Add condition .\n\nIn Prorate on , choose on what basis you want to issue a percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. If bill amount, choose a current event, if tracker, choose current aggregate or previous aggregate.\n\nEvent default value : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\n\nCurrent aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction.\n\nPrevious aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction.\n\nSelect the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure.\n\ni. Mandatory channels : You can select the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure. Then, configure the message for each channel you select.\n\nii. Priority channels : Here, you can set the channels through which the communication needs to be sent out based on the priority and availability. For example, if you set the priority in the order SMS, email, and mobile push, the system will first check if the customer's mobile number is available,\n\nIf available, it will send an SMS communication and ignore the rest.\n\nIf not available, it will check whether the customer has an email ID\n\nIf an email ID is available, it sends out an email notification to the customer.\n\nIf not, it will check if the customer is active through mobile push and process the message accordingly.\n\nClick on Save .\n\nUpgrade using tier\n\nYou can upgrade customers using the tier conditions when they satisfy a certain condition. It could be regarding the rewards they earned or just a general notification.\n\nTo configure the Upgrade using tier action, follow these steps:\n\nIn Action, select Upgrade using tier .\n\nIn User entity , choose Individual to issue points to customers who met the condition.\nOR\nChoose Group to issue points to the group (Deprecated).\n\nTo issue points, enable Award points.\n\nIn the Earn condition , choose the earning condition that you want to associate using the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on + Add Condition .\n\nIn Expiry condition , choose the expiry for the points using the drop-down list.\nTo create a new expiry earn condition, click + Add condition .\n\nIn Prorate on , choose on what basis you want to issue percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. For bill amount, you can choose the Current event , for tracker, you can choose Current aggregate or Previous aggregate .\n\nEvent default value : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\n\nCurrent aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction.\n\nPrevious aggregate : Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction.\n\nIssue Coupon\n\nThis action allows you to issue coupons based on a specific activity.\n\nThe coupons used here are the ones which are claimed by loyalty in strategies.\n\nNote\n\nNOTE:\n\nAll quantity values, whether initially provided as integers or decimals, will always be converted to integers. Decimal values will be rounded accordingly. For example, 4.7 will be rounded to 5, while 3.2 will be rounded to 3.\n\nCoupon issue types\n\n1. Fixed Quantity:\n\nFixed quantity lets you allocate a predetermined number of coupons either uniformly across all tiers or uniquely for each tier.\n\nSame for all tiers: Set a single, fixed quantity of coupons to be issued across all tiers.\nFor example, if you allocate 10 coupons, each customer, regardless of tier, receives 10 coupons for completing an action.\n\nDifferent for each tier: Set a different quantity of coupons for each tier.\nFor example, Tier 1 customers are issued 20 coupons, Tier 2 are issued 30 coupons, and Tier 3 are issued 50 coupons for completing an action.\n\n2. Transaction Step Function\n\nThe transaction step function dynamically allocates coupons based on transaction amounts, either uniformly across all tiers or uniquely for each tier.\n\nNote\n\nNote:\n\nThe Transaction Step Function is triggered only when a Transactional Event is performed by the customer. For all other events Fixed Quantity is supported.\n\nSame for All Tiers: Set a specific transaction amount and fixed quantity of coupons to issue across all tiers.\nFor example, for every transaction worth ₹1000, each customer, regardless of their tier, will be issued 10 coupons for completing the transaction.\n\nDifferent for Each Tier: Set a specific transaction amount and different quantity of coupons for each tier.\nFor example, for every transaction worth ₹1000, Tier 1 customers receive 20 coupons, Tier 2 receive 30 coupons, and Tier 3 receive 50 coupons for completing the transaction.\n\nThe maximum number of coupon that can be allocated to the customer is 500 .\n\nIssue Catalog Reward\n\nYou can use the Issue Catalog Reward option to reward customers for specific events. For example, you can issue rewards to customers who register for your loyalty program or, in a health and fitness app, to those who burn 500 kilocalories in a day.\n\nOnce you create a reward in Marvel Reward UI , you can issue it based on different events. Rewards can be triggered by:\n\nPromotions : Customers automatically receive rewards when they join promotional campaigns.\n\nMilestones : Rewards are issued when customers reach specific milestones, like spending a certain amount or completing a set number of purchases.\n\nEvents : Customers earn rewards by initiating transaction, customer, or measurable behavioral events (with the datatype integer or double).\n\nYou can issue rewards through Issue Catalog Reward using the following:\n\nFor milestones, streaks, and behavioural events, use Loyalty Promotions flow.\n\nFor other events, use Loyalty Program workflows.\n\nFollow these steps to issue a catalog reward:\n\nFrom the Add Action window, click on Issue Catalog Reward .\n\nClick Save .\nThe Add action: Issue catalog reward window opens.\n\nClick Save .\nThe Add action: Issue catalog reward window opens.\n\nA note appears in the window stating: The behavior of the \"Issue Catalog Rewards\" action differs when configured in the \"Point to Reward Conversion\" customer event compared to other events. This means the behaviour of Issue Catalog Rewards differs between the Point to Reward Conversion and other events such as the Customer Registration Transaction Add , Points Redemption etc.\n\nThe table below shows the difference in the behaviour of Issue Catalog Rewards action for Customer Registration and Point to Reward Conversion events.\n\nChoose the Reward you want to issue from the dropdown.\nThe active catalog rewards with Live and Upcoming statuses appear here.\n\nChoose one of the following from the Reward quantity same as dropdown:\n\na. Add Manually i. Select Add Manually to specify the number of rewards you want to issue to a customer.\nii. In Add manually field, enter the number of rewards.\n\nb. Transaction Extended Field i. Select Transaction Extended Field to set the number of rewards a customer receives based on the value captured by the transaction extended field .\nii. Select the transaction attribute or value that determines the reward quantity using the Select transaction extended field drop-down.\nFor example, if the transaction extended field Gross Weight value is 50, the system issues 50 rewards.\n\nc. Points Issued on Event i. Select Points Issued on Event to give rewards based on the points a customer earns during an event.\nFor example, if a customer earns 10 points during an event, they get 10 rewards. The system uses the points earned to decide the number of rewards.\n\n(Optional) Choose the Fulfilment status from the drop-down. Fulfilment status allows you to track and assign a specific status to a reward when it is given to a customer. By setting a fulfilment status, you can let the customer know the reward status whether it is been shipped , is on the way , or being processed .\n\n(Optional) Choose the Fulfilment status from the drop-down. Fulfilment status allows you to track and assign a specific status to a reward when it is given to a customer. By setting a fulfilment status, you can let the customer know the reward status whether it is been shipped , is on the way , or being processed .\n\n(Optional) Add additional information about the issuance of the reward under Notes .  This information is shared with the vendor responsible for fulfilling the reward.\n\n(Optional) Add additional information about the issuance of the reward under Notes .

This action will be available in both the loyalty programs & loyalty promotions.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf you want to change the \"label\" of all the customers who made transactions worth more than 10,000 as \"high-value\", it can be done with this action directly from workflows.\n\nIf you want to change the \"label\" of all the customers who made more than 5 returns to \"suspecting\", it can be simply done with this action.\n\nTo use this action, do the following steps. Go to workflow -> action, and there you'll find:\n\nAn action \"change customer status & label\"\n\nNow select the status & label you want to configure. Note that, the label is unique across status. This means that, when you are selecting the label, you are selecting the status also.\n\nYou'll find that configured action in the display once it is done.\n\nIn this way, you can change the status & label of your customers directly from workflows.\n\nPromised alternate currency conversion\n\nThis action allows you to allocate promised points in alternate currencies (e.g., \"Gold Coins,\" \"Travel Miles\") to customers during specific transactional events. These points are \"promised\" (not immediately usable) and convert to the actual alternate currency after a delay or based on configured rules. This action is supported only for the TransactionUpdate customer activity.\n\nExample: Reward customers with 50 promised \"Travel Miles\" after a flight booking update, which convert to actual miles 30 days later if there are no cancellations.\n\nTo enable this action for your loyalty program follow these steps,\n\nSelect the loyalty program where you want the action to apply.\n\nSelect Edit Program .\n\nGo to the Workflows section in the loyalty program.\n\nChange the Customer Activity to Updates a transaction .\n\nSelect the Condition where you want the action to apply. To create a new Condition , select + Condition\n\nSelect +When to define a new condition.\n\nDefine the conditions in the Expression field if required.\n\nSelect + Add action to add a new action.\n\nSelect the Promised <alternate currency name> Conversion action.\n\nSelect the User entity and Date of conversion to regular points for the action.\n\nThe fields are as follows:\n\nSelect Save to save the changes made to the action.\n\nSelect Save and Continue to save the changes made to the workflow.\n\nSelect Publish changes to publish the changes.\n\nTier upgrade and downgrade when converting promised alternate currencies\n\nIf a loyalty program is set up to upgrade or downgrade a customer based on the number of alternate currencies they currently possess, then the promised alternate currency conversion action will influence the tier upgrade or downgrade for that customer.\n\nFor example:\n\nA brand has configured their loyalty program tiers that track two alternate currencies (gold coins and silver coins) as: Tier 1 : The customer has less than 50 gold coins and less than 50 silver coins. Tier 2 : The customer has more than 50 gold coins or more than 50 silver coins. Tier 3 : The customer has more than 50 gold coins and more than 50 silver coins.\n\nScenario 1: Gradual Upgrade\n\nDay 0 – Transaction with Promised Coins: The customer earns 60 promised gold coins and 30 promised silver coins.\n**Tier Status: ** Remains Tier 1 as promised coins don’t count immediately.\n\nDay 7 – Conversion: Promised coins convert to regular coins.\nNow, the customer has 60 regular gold coins and 30 regular silver coins. Tier Status: Upgraded to Tier 2 because at least one coin type (gold) is over 50.\n\nDay 8 – New Transaction (Mixed Rewards): The customer earns 60 regular gold coins and 30 additional promised silver coins.\n**Tier Status: ** Still Tier 2, because while the gold remains above 50, the new silver coins are still promised.\n\nDay 15 – Full Conversion: All coins are now regular.\nThe customer has 60 regular gold coins and 60 regular silver coins.\n**Tier Status: **Upgraded to Tier 3 since both gold and silver are above 50.\n\nScenario 2: Cancellation Impact Day 0 – Transaction with Promised Coins: The customer earns 60 promised gold coins and 30 promised silver coins.\n**Tier Status: ** Remains Tier 1 as promised coins don’t count immediately.\n\nDay 5 – Cancellation: The silver transaction is canceled.\nNow, the customer has 60 promised gold coins and 0 promised silver coins.\n**Tier Status: **Stays in Tier 1 because the cancellation leaves the customer with no silver coins.\n\nDay 7 – Conversion: The 60 promised gold coins convert to 60 regular gold coins.\nThe customer now has 60 regular gold coins and 0 regular silver coins. Tier Status: Remains Tier 1 since the silver is still below 50.\n\nPoints redemption reversal\n\nThis action returns previously redeemed points to the customer’s account if they choose not to use them for a transaction, or if the transaction is returned or canceled. It is only applicable for the Redeemed points get reversed customer activity.\n\nExample: A customer spends 20 points to get a discount voucher but later changes their mind and wants to cancel it. The Points Redemption Reversal action lets the 20 points be returned to the customer in this case.\n\nTo enable this action for your loyalty program follow these steps,\n\nSelect the loyalty program where you want the action to apply.\n\nSelect Edit Program .\n\nGo to the Workflows section in the loyalty program.\n\nChange the Customer Activity to Redeemed points get reversed .\n\nSelect the Condition where you want the action to apply. To create a new Condition , select + Condition\n\nSelect +When to define a new condition.\n\nDefine the conditions in the Expression field if required.\n\nSelect + Add action to add a new action.\n\nSelect the Points redemption reversal action.\n\nSelect the User entity and Expiry condition for the action.\n\nThe fields are as follows:\n\nSelect Save to save the changes made to the action.\n\nSelect Save and Continue to save the changes made to the workflow.\n\nSelect Publish changes to publish the changes.\n\nReversal of expired redeemed points\n\nThe system does not return points that have already expired when you reverse a redemption using the Redeemed_Points_Reversal_Default_Expiry return condition. If the original expiry date has passed, those expired points are not credited back to the customer.\n\nFor example, a customer redeems 1,000 points on April 28. Of these points, 300 expire on April 30. If the customer reverses the transaction on May 5, the system returns only 700 points because the other 300 have expired.\n\nTo have all expired points returned, choose a different return condition.\n\nUpdated 11 days ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/rule-writing", "title": "Rule Writing", "text": "Rule Writing\n\nThe Rules Engine in RTIM allows users to set up conditional responses to customer activities. Rules are written using a standard “Expression Editor” which works with a pseudo-code format that allows powerful combinations of conditions. Rules engine has a large library of supported conditions and expressions out of the box for a wide range of use cases. RTIM and rules engine are used across various products and modules e.g. Loyalty+, Loyalty Promotions, Cart Promotions, Target Loyalty.\n\nAnatomy of a rule\n\nA rule consists of a profile, attribute, operator, and value.\n\nProfiles in rules\n\ncurrentCustomer (Customer Profile) - Allows you to write conditions based on the properties of the customer who is currently performing the activity\n\ncurrentTxn (Transaction Profile) - In Transaction related events this profile allows you to write conditions based on the properties of the transaction (e.g. net amount, category of items present in the txn, etc.)\n\ncurrentLineItem (Line Item Profile) - In Transaction related events this profile allows you to specify conditions relating to properties of individual items (note: This only works with line item unrolling)\n\ntenderProfile (Payment Method Profile) - In Txn related events this profile allows you to specify conditions relating to individual payment methods used (note: This only works with payment method unrolling)\n\ncurrentEvent (The “Event” Profile) - This is a dynamic profile that allows you to write conditions pertaining to that particular customer activity. Its properties are different across the different customer activities\n\ncurrentTrackerCondition (Tracker Profile) - Inside the Tracker set, this profile allows you to write conditions based on the properties of that particular tracker case\n\nTo read in detail about profiles and attributes click here\n\nCompleting a valid expression\n\nAn expression is considered valid as long as it resolves into a true or a false condition. This can be achieved, by as simple a condition as simply ”true”. Or by completing the appropriate operator and value for the data type. Or even by combining multiple attributes of similar data types together.\n\nData Types in Expression Editor\n\nNumbers - These can be integer or double (i.e. decimal values), for example, avgBasketSize, grossAmount, rate, etc.\n\nString - These are a string of alphanumeric charactersfor example, firstname, email, notes, etc.\n\nDate - These are date and time values, for example, joinDate, slabExpiryDate, etc.\n\nBoolean - These are true/false values and won’t need further operators, for example, isControl, isUserGroupInfoPresent, etc.\n\nNumerical operations\n\nThe basic range of supported operations on numbers allow us to resolve the number to a boolean outcome through comparison with another value, and these include:\n\nequal to (=)\n\nnot equal to (!=)\n\ngreater than (>)\n\ngreater than or equal to (>=)\n\nlesser than (<)\n\nlesser than or equal to (<=)\n\nOutside of these, users can also perform mathematical operations to transform the value of the numerical attribute, the supported operations for transformation are:\n\nAddition (+)\n\nSubtraction (-)\n\nMultiplication (*)\n\nDivision (/)\n\nMod operation - this provides the remainder after division (%)\n\nString operations\n\nThe basic range of string operations serve to resolve the string attribute into a boolean outcome.\n\nThese operators are inserted after the string attribute using the . notation e.g. currentCustomer.email.contains(\".com\")\n\nThe following are the string operators:\n\nContains - used to see if the string contains the defined value Matches - this is used to perform regular expression based matching on the string isValidDate - used to check if the string is a proper date field Exists - Some proper value exists for this string (i.e. source passed a value that was not an empty string) notExists - The string is either Null or Empty isEmpty - Similar to notExists isNull - checks if the string is Null i.e. it was not passed from the source. isNotNull - checks if the the string is NOT Null i.e. some value was passed from the source (even an empty string counts)\n\nA regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. You can use Regular Expressions for all string attributes using the .matches operator\n\nThere are also some attributes that support regular expressions as part of its arguments, e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\".SW\")\n\nSome common useful expressions include:\n\n. - allows you to match with any character e.g. .SW matches with CSW, VSW, eSW, etc.\n\n[] - allows you to match from a set of characters e.g. [CV]SW matches with CSW or VSW\n\n| - acts like an or and allows you to search for different possibilities within the same attribute e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"shoes|sneakers\")\n\n^ - matches characters at the start of the entire string e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"^[Pp]remium\")\n\n$ - matches characters at the end of the entire string e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"[Ff]uel$\")\n\n\\w \\s \\d - allows you to see if there’s any alphabet, any space or any digit/number respectively e.g. currentCustomer.firstname.matches(\"\\s\")\n\nDate operations\n\nThe basic range of date operations serves to resolve the date attribute into a boolean outcome. You will commonly be combining multiple attributes in date operations since you will be comparing dates\n\nisValid - simply checks if a valid date is present in that field e.g. currentCustomer.joinDate.isValid( ) dateDiff - absolute difference between 2 dates e.g. currentCustomer.joinDate.dateDiff(currentTxn.date)==0 daysDiff - same as dateDiff, but ignores the year. Useful for anniversary type promotions e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.daysDiff(currentTxn.date)==0 daysDiffFromString - same as daysDiff, but when you want to use an attribute that could be saved as a string minutesDiff - absolute difference similar to dateDiff, but looks at minutes day - day of the week, week starts on Sunday as 1 e.g. Terrific Tuesdays would be currentTxn.date.day( )==3 dayOfMonth - date of the month e.g. For offers on the first 5 days of each month currentTxn.date.dayOfMonth( )<=5 month - month number is returned e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.month( )==currentTxn.date.month( ) year - returns the year from the date e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.year( )>=1981&¤tCustomer.extField_dob_date.year( )<=1996 isAfter - checks if the attribute occurs after a defined date-time e.g. currentTxn.date.isAfter(YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MM,SS) isHourBetween - scenarios like happy hours. hour in 24 hour format e.g. currentTxn.date.isHourBetween(HH,HH) isTimeBetween - similar to happy hours, but when minutes also matter e.g. currentTxn.date.isTimeBetween(HH,MM,HH,MM) isWeekday - checks if the date is a weekday e.g. currentTxn.date.isWeekday( ) isWeekend - checks if the date is a weekend e.g. currentTxn.date.isWeekend( ) isNull - checks if the the date is Null i.e. it was not passed from source isNotNull - checks if the the date is NOT Null i.e. some value was passed from source\n\nAdding multiple expressions and using brackets\n\nYou can chain together multiple valid expressions using AND (&&) or an OR (||) condition between them\n\nYou can use brackets to combine various parts of the expression to control the order in which the expression is checked, particularly to combine AND and OR type expressions as per the use case\n\ne.g. to check if a customer has either bought for $100 or more in a completely non-discounted transaction, or for $300 or more then you can say ((currentTxn.value>=100)&&(currentTxn.basketSumIf(\"DISCOUNT\",\"NOT_EQUAL_TO\",\"0\")==0))||(currentTxn.value>=300)\n\nSome tips for efficient rule writing and handling common issues\n\nUse scope early on and wherever possible to restrict the events being processed by conditions unnecessarily\n\nReduce redundancies in rule writing through efficient use of the forward to set action - this action is not just for unrolling, it provides an efficient of setting up “global filters” E.g. if you have a program construct where only certain concepts qualify for “earning” and only customers in tier ‘Silver’ and above can earn points, create these as scope and conditions in Set 1 itself and forward from there for all other conditions and actions\n\nUse regular expressions to reduce the need for multiple OR conditions and repeating the same expression\n\nEnsure expressions match the unrolling status of the ruleset and ensure that the rulesets don’t have nested unrolling actions inside\n\nCheck for mathematical operations that might lead to irrational numbers e.g. dividing by zero\n\nString matches can be case sensitive, and might fail because of input errors, as far as possible use the system suggested values or use regular expressions to adjust for those kinds of situations if needed\n\nUsing combinations of expressions with ==true or ==false along with the “when expression is false” to specify the action can get confusing, so try to avoid double negatives\n\nSample Scenarios\n\nIncentivizing on High Spending Customers\n\nIssuing Coupons for current transaction amounts exceeding a certain value Consider that you want to issue coupons for customers whose current transaction amount is greater than 5000, then use the following condition:\n\ncurrentTxn.value>5000\n\nFor transaction amounts equal to a certain value, use currentTxn.value==5000\n\nIssuing Coupons for the current transaction amount between two defined values Consider that you want to issue coupons for customers whose current transaction amount is greater than 1000, but less than 5000, then use the following condition:\n\ncurrentTxn.value>1000&&(currentTxn.value<5000)\n\nTo learn more about current Transaction profile, and value profile click here\n\nIncentivizing on Customer Name and Transaction Amount\n\nSuppose that your store founder’s name is “John Smith” and you want to issue coupons to customers whose name matches that of the founder.

This ensures that points are issued only until the set threshold is reached.\n\nTypes of limits\n\nThere are two types of limits for which points can be capped.\n\nIndividual transaction limits : These limits are applied at each transactional level. For each successful transaction, points are issued based on the conditions set. You can create a maximum of ten individual transaction limits for a loyalty program. Example: A retailer limits loyalty points to a maximum of  300 points per transaction. If a customer makes a purchase of ₹1000 and could earn 1000 points, they will only receive 300 points due to the limit. This helps the retailer manage their points.\n\nIndividual transaction limits : These limits are applied at each transactional level. For each successful transaction, points are issued based on the conditions set. You can create a maximum of ten individual transaction limits for a loyalty program. Example: A retailer limits loyalty points to a maximum of  300 points per transaction. If a customer makes a purchase of ₹1000 and could earn 1000 points, they will only receive 300 points due to the limit. This helps the retailer manage their points.\n\nIndividual Customer Limits: These limits are set at the customer level. When choosing this limit type, you can specify both the 'duration of the limit' and the 'audience type' to which it will apply—options include all customers, specific customers, or customers enrolled via API. You can create up to ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience type and a maximum of 50 limits for other audience types. However, the total number of limits across all audience types cannot exceed 50. For instance, if you define ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience, you can only create 40 limits for specific customers and those enrolled via API combined.\n\nIndividual Customer Limits: These limits are set at the customer level. When choosing this limit type, you can specify both the 'duration of the limit' and the 'audience type' to which it will apply—options include all customers, specific customers, or customers enrolled via API.\n\nYou can create up to ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience type and a maximum of 50 limits for other audience types. However, the total number of limits across all audience types cannot exceed 50. For instance, if you define ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience, you can only create 40 limits for specific customers and those enrolled via API combined.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can increase the reward currency allocation limit for your organisation. To request an increase, create a JIRA ticket for the Capillary Product Support team. Include the desired maximum limits for both individual and transaction-based capping rules. The relevant configuration keys are:\n\nCONF_EVENT_CAPPING_CREATION_MAX_LIMIT : Sets the total number of customer event capping rules allowed for an organization.\n\nCONF_AUTO_ENROL_EVENT_CAPPING_CREATION_MAX_LIMIT : Sets the maximum number of transaction-based capping rules allowed for an organization.\n\nCreating a points / alternate currency allocation limit\n\nTo create a points / alternate currency allocation limit, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to a loyalty program and select Edit Program .\n\nSelect Advanced settings and navigate to the Points Allocation Limits section.\n\nSelect +Add Limit to open the Add points allocation limit window.\n\nEnter the required details and define the KPI and limit values. The fields are as follows:\n\nField\n\nDescription\n\nName\n\nA unique name for the allocation limit.\n\nLimit on\n\nThe entity type on which the limit will be set. Refer to the section for more information on types of limits .\n\nReward currency\n\nThe reward currency to apply capping. Capping can be applied on points or alternate currencies . The available alternate currencies for the organisation are listed in the drop down.\n\nCurrency limit based on\n\nThe KPI on which the limit will be set. Refer to the section for more information on types of KPIs .\n\nLimit value\n\nThe maximum number of reward currency (points or alternate currency) that can be awarded to the customer.\n\nScope\n\nApply capping based on a specific scope. The scopes are as follows: - All transactions: Apply capping for all transactions. - Brands : Apply capping for a brand in the organisation. - Categories : Apply capping for a category in the organisation. - Custom attributes : Apply capping for a product attribute in the organisation. - SKU : Apply capping on a list of SKUs. You can upload a .csv file containing the list of SKUs. - Store : Apply capping for a store in the organisation. - Zone : Apply capping for a zone in the organisation. Notes: - Brands, categories, custom attributes, SKU, store and zone can be filtered only for the Line-item amount and Line-item quantity KPIs. - The default option is All transactions .\n\nActivity (Applicable for individual customer limits)\n\nThe customer activity on which the limit is set. You can set activities for the following types: All Activities: The limit is active for all customer activities . Points earned by the user from any activity (transaction, behavioural events) will be tracked under the capping. Transaction Add: The limit is active only for transaction related activities.\n\nAudience (Applicable for individual customer limits)\n\nWhen setting the limit, you can choose from the following customer segments: All Customers: Includes every loyalty customer in the program. Specific Customers: Capping only for the customers defined in the selected audience group. Refer to the documentation for more information on audience groups . Enrol via API: Incorporates customers enrolled in the capping through the Enrol/Re-enrol a customer to a milestone/streak API .\n\nRefreshes every (Applicable for individual customer limits)\n\nThe time period for refreshing the limit. When the limit is refreshed, the customer can begin earning reward currencies till the limit is reached. The supported options are daily, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and yearly.\n\n1st cycle starts on (Applicable for individual customer limits)\n\nThe start date of the 1st cycle or the date from which capping is enabled for the customer.\n\nTotal number of cycles (Applicable for individual customer limits)\n\nThe total number of times the limit is refreshed. Currently, the maximum number of cycles supported is 10.\n\nPromotions\n\nInclude or exclude any active or upcoming loyalty promotions from the limit or include all active loyalty promotions part of the loyalty program. Select the action ( Include , Exclude or All ) from the drop down and select the loyalty promotions.\n\nAll: Allocation limits are created only for all active loyalty promotions. Include: Allocation limits are created only for the selected loyalty promotions.   - Exclude: Allocation limits are not created for the selected loyalty promotions. Note: You can only include or exclude a loyalty promotion; you cannot simultaneously do both.\n\nExample: A coffee shop chain BrewLabs sets a 500-point monthly limit per customer that resets every month. They run three loyalty promotions:\nDouble Points Tuesdays\nBirthday Bonus\nRefer-a-Friend Bonus\n\nALL: Apply the cap to every loyalty promotion:    BrewLabs selects all loyalty promotions for the 500-point cap.\nResult: A customer can earn max 500 points total from all combined loyalty promotions per month. INCLUDE: Apply the cap only to specific loyalty promotions.    BrewLabs includes only Double Points Tuesdays and Refer-a-Friend Bonus.\nResult: - The 500-point cap applies only to these two - Birthday Bonus points don’t count toward the cap (unlimited). EXCLUDE: Apply the cap to all promotions except specific ones.    BrewLabs excludes the Birthday Bonus.\nResult: - Birthday Bonus points are exempt from the cap (unlimited). - All other promotions (Double Points Tuesdays + Refer-a-Friend) share the 500-point limit.\n\nSelect Done to save the changes.\n\nTypes of KPIs\n\nThere are five types of KPIs available through which points can be limited.\n\nReward currencies This is how the brands can directly apply capping on points or alternate currencies. There are three types of cappings for which limits can be applied: Regular: Loyalty points or alternate currencies issued to customers. These are the points from the programs. Promotional: Bonus points or alternate currencies that are awarded to the customer irrespective of any transaction. These are from the loyalty promotions. Regular + Promotional: A combination of regular and promotional points or alternate currencies. Example: A brand wants to issue a maximum of 1000 regular points on each transaction done by a customer.\n\nReward currencies\n\nThis is how the brands can directly apply capping on points or alternate currencies. There are three types of cappings for which limits can be applied:\n\nRegular: Loyalty points or alternate currencies issued to customers. These are the points from the programs.\n\nPromotional: Bonus points or alternate currencies that are awarded to the customer irrespective of any transaction. These are from the loyalty promotions.\n\nRegular + Promotional: A combination of regular and promotional points or alternate currencies.\n\nExample: A brand wants to issue a maximum of 1000 regular points on each transaction done by a customer.\n\nLine-item amount This is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item amount. A line item refers to the individual products or services that a brand offers. Benefits can be capped based on transactions for that category of line items. Example: A brand wants to issue benefits for beverage transactions of up to ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on beverages that are above this limit.\n\nLine-item amount\n\nThis is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item amount. A line item refers to the individual products or services that a brand offers. Benefits can be capped based on transactions for that category of line items.\n\nExample: A brand wants to issue benefits for beverage transactions of up to ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on beverages that are above this limit.\n\nLine-item quantity This is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item quantity. A line item refers to the individual products or services offered by a brand. Benefits can be capped based on the quantity for that category of line items. Example: A brand wants to issue benefits for fuel transactions of up to ten liters. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on fuel that are above this limit.\n\nLine-item quantity\n\nThis is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item quantity. A line item refers to the individual products or services offered by a brand. Benefits can be capped based on the quantity for that category of line items.\n\nExample: A brand wants to issue benefits for fuel transactions of up to ten liters. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on fuel that are above this limit.\n\nTransaction amount Benefits can be capped based on the transaction amount. Example: A brand wants to issue benefits up to a total transaction amount of ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit.\n\nTransaction amount\n\nBenefits can be capped based on the transaction amount.\n\nExample: A brand wants to issue benefits up to a total transaction amount of ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit.\n\nTransaction count Benefits can be capped based on the number of transactions done by a customer. Example: A brand wants to issue benefits for up to five transactions done by a customer. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit. This limit will be refreshed based on the defined period for the customer.\n\nTransaction count\n\nBenefits can be capped based on the number of transactions done by a customer.\n\nExample: A brand wants to issue benefits for up to five transactions done by a customer. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit. This limit will be refreshed based on the defined period for the customer.\n\nNotes:\n\nBoth line-item amount & line-item quantity type of capping cannot be used together. For example, if a capping is created based on line-item amount (in either the individual transaction capping or individual customer capping), then the line-item quantity capping cannot be used.\n\nThe transaction count limit is applicable only for individual customer limits.\n\nCapping in multi-loyalty programs\n\nOrganizations with multiple loyalty programs may have a default program and several loyalty programs configured. When a customer makes a purchase, the transaction is processed through the source program first, followed by the default program. Capping is processed in the same order. Capping rules for the source program are checked before those for the default program.\n\nExample : A loyalty program allows 300 points while the default program allows 200 points per transaction. If a customer makes a transaction, they will get 300 points from the loyalty program and only 200 points from the default program.\n\nTransaction amount capping in tracker sets and points trackers\n\nTransaction Amount-Based Capping : While transaction amount-based capping limits (e.g., limiting the points awarded based on a transaction cap of $500) apply across most rule sets, they are typically not enforced within tracker sets or points trackers . This means that in tracker evaluations, the full transaction amount is considered for points calculation, even if it exceeds a predefined cap.\n\nHowever, cappings related to transaction count and points allocation do apply universally across all rule sets, including tracker sets and points trackers. This ensures that overall program limits, like the total number of transactions or maximum points awarded, remain consistent and are adhered to across all rule evaluations.\n\nExample scenario\n\nCapping Configuration :\n\nTransaction Amount Cap : Points should only be allocated on a maximum of $500 per transaction.\n\nTransaction Count Cap : Maximum of 3 transactions allowed within a rolling 30-day period.\n\nPoints Cap : Customers can earn up to 5,000 points per transaction.\n\nCustomer Transactions :\n\nTransaction 1 : Customer spends $800 on 1st September. Points Earned : Based on the transaction cap, points should only be calculated on $500, resulting in: $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTransaction 1 : Customer spends $800 on 1st September.\n\nPoints Earned : Based on the transaction cap, points should only be calculated on $500, resulting in: $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\n$500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTransaction 2 : Customer spends $1,200 on 10th September. Points Earned : Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTransaction 2 : Customer spends $1,200 on 10th September.\n\nPoints Earned : Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTransaction 3 : Customer spends $700 on 20th September. Points Earned : Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTransaction 3 : Customer spends $700 on 20th September.\n\nPoints Earned : Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% = 250 points .\n\nTracker set evaluation\n\nSuppose a points tracker is configured to evaluate these transactions:\n\nTracker Action : The tracker evaluates each transaction amount and applies actions based on it (e.g., tier progression or issuing a reward).\n\nIn the tracker set:\n\nTransaction 1 : Points awarded based on full $800 (ignoring the transaction amount cap) resulting in 800 * 50% = 400 points .\n\nTransaction 2 : Points awarded based on full $1,200, resulting in 1,200 * 50% = 600 points .\n\nTransaction 3 : Points awarded based on full $700, resulting in 700 * 50% = 350 points .\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCan I add quantity and amount limits together? No, line-item amount and line-item quantity capping cannot be applied together. This is because the line-item amount and line-item quantity both refer to the same information on a transaction. Calculating them differently on the same item can cause ambiguity and computational challenges while applying capping.\n\nCan I add quantity and amount limits together?\n\nNo, line-item amount and line-item quantity capping cannot be applied together. This is because the line-item amount and line-item quantity both refer to the same information on a transaction. Calculating them differently on the same item can cause ambiguity and computational challenges while applying capping.\n\nHow does it work with set-level capping?

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/loyalty-promotions", "title": "Getting started", "text": "Getting started\n\nIntroduction\n\nPromotions are special loyalty programs that can run for a short period of time by rewarding customers with something extra from their basic loyalty programs. For example, you can drive sales through promotion programs by rewarding additional points or coupons to customers during a festival season or promoting a specific product.\nYou can run promotion programs either at a transaction level, line item level, or customer level. Based on the event, the promotion type varies automatically. For example, in customer events, you cannot create transaction promotions and vice versa.\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot create promotion programs for all events. For example, you cannot create promotions on events, ReturnTransaction, TransactionUpdate, DelayedAccrual, SlabUpgrade, and all group events (such as GroupTransactionAdd, GroupTransactionUpdate, GroupReturnTransaction, GroupMemberJoin, and GroupMemberLeave).\n\nYou can create transaction or transaction line-item promotions only for the TransactionAdd event. For all other applicable events, you can create only customer-level promotion programs.\n\nYou cannot award points to the referrer or referee through loyalty promotions. Points for referral actions must be configured separately, via workflows in the default loyalty program, not through these promotion types.\n\nTo create a promotion program, do the following\n\nOn the loyalty program configuration page, go to Workflows and then go to Loyalty Promotions .\n\nOr, you can go over to the Promotions tab on the top right.\n\nAlready active promotions can be seen in list view or calendar view.\n\nAnd the existing promotions can also be filtered according to program, activity and status of the promotion.\n\nIn the calendar view, a grid line can be set up according to the timeline required.\n\nClick on Create Promotion .\n\nFill in the basic details.\n\nIn Promotion Name , specify a name for the promotion.\n\nIn Description , enter a short description of the current promotion.\n\nSelect Customer Activity that would trigger earning.\n\nCustomer activities\n\nThe following table lists the available customer activities:\n\nCustomer Activity\n\nDescription\n\nExample\n\nMakes a transaction\n\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they make a purchase in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\n\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\n\nMilestone or Streak is updated\n\nA customer achieves a milestone by drinking 50 litres of water in a week.\n\nA customer achieves a streak by walking 10,000 steps everyday for a week.\n\nRedeems points\n\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they use their points to redeem rewards.\n\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\n\nRedeems a coupon\n\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they use coupons to get discounts or benefits.\n\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\n\nGets enroled in the program\n\nA customer makes a transaction of above ₹10,000 and is enrolled into a loyalty program.\n\nUpdates customer profile\n\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they update their personal information on their profile.\n\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\n\nIn Promotion applied on , choose Transaction Level to award points on a transaction or choose Lineitem level to issue points on the transaction line items. Note: This field is visible only when you have selected transaction-related customer activity in the previous step.\n\nSet Activate to Yes to enable the program.\n\nSet the duration of the promotion in Start Date and End Date . NOTE : Promotion duration can be in the past, up to the last 12 months. Once a promotion has started, the start date cannot be edited; however, you can still change the start date for any promotions that are upcoming.\n\nNote\n\nSample Scenario for Exclusive option\n\nAssume two promotion programs where Promotion2 is set as EXCLUSIVE.\nPromotion1: If the transaction amount is greater than $500, reward points of 10% of the transaction amount\nPromotion2: If the transaction amount is greater than $750, reward points of 15% of the transaction amount.\n\nNow when a customer makes a transaction for $800, instead of rewarding points for both the promotion programs, only promotion2 will be executed, i.e., 120 points (15% of 800).\n\nOnce the promotion program is created, configure rulesets for each event as explained in the following.\n\nNow the promotion workflows need to be configured. In All Conditions , click +Condition to add a new rule. Each condition you dd will have a condition sequence as the prefix. For example, Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, and so on.\n\nNote\n\nNote\n\nIf you want to delete any condition, click on the respective Delete icon. The sequence will be updated accordingly.\n\nYou also have the option to rename the set if you wish to modify its title, providing greater flexibility in organizing and managing your sets more effectively.\n\nYou also have the option to rename the set if you wish to modify its title, providing greater flexibility in organizing and managing your sets more effectively.\n\nIn the Expression box, define the rule expression that you want to evaluate for the current promotion. Use the predefined methods and attributes to write rule expression such that the result should be a Boolean value.\n\nIn the Expression box, define the rule expression that you want to evaluate for the current promotion. Use the predefined methods and attributes to write rule expression such that the result should be a Boolean value.\n\nIn When , configure the following fields.\n\nIn Expression Equals, set whether to execute an action for True case or False case .\n\nClick the +Add Action icon and select the respective action to execute.\n\nYou can also add \"Scope\" to the program to limit the promotion to loyalty or non-loyalty users, specific stores, zones, concepts, clusters or date ranges.\n\nNote\n\nNote\n\nWhen selecting a specific zone or a concept from the list, Selecting ROOT selects all the listed options.\n\nBased on the option selected, the respective configuration field appears under the Expression equals box.  For example, if the action is Allocate points, fields to configure Points Allocation appears as shown below.\n\nClick Save to save the promotion program.\n\nYou can add \"Advanced Settings\" to the program, but this step is optional.\n\nClick Publish Promotion to apply the changes to the live program.\n\nWarning\n\nNote\n\nPublishing a promotion will also publish any changes made to the associated loyalty program. To publish promotions and loyalty programs separately, raise a ticket to the sustenance team. Once enabled, this change is permanent and cannot be reverted.\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nIssue\n\nThe issue section allows you define when the loyalty promotion will expire and limit the number of times a loyalty promotion can be issued and redeemed by a customer.\n\nIssual Expiry\n\nYou can define the issue duration of the loyalty promotion in the issual expiry section. This is the duration within which a customer must complete the defined activity to earn the benefits of the promotion.\n\nThere are two ways a promotion can expire:\n\nIssual Limit\n\nYou can define limits on the number of times a loyalty promotion is issued to a customer and the number of times it can be redeemed by the customer.\n\nThere are three where is a promotion limit can be defined:\n\nPoints Allocation limits\n\nThese limits or capping let you budget the points that will be allocated via these promotions. This can done in various ways & combinations :\n\nMaximum number of point activities for a member - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.\n\nMaximum points to be allocated in a single activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.\n\nMaximum points to be allocated to a member - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .\n\nMaximum points to be allocated from overall promotion - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.\n\nLimits when Advance Promotions capabilities are enabled\n\nWhen Advance Loyalty Promotions feature is enabled, these points allocation limits become more flexible and provides wider variety of limits to be configured.\n\nThe key differentiator here, are the specific time durations for these limits. You can define these limits apply within :\n\nPromotion Duration - This ideally means, that there is no specific time duration set in this case, because these limits are anyways applicable for the time promotion is active.\n\na day - Setting this means the limit is applicable within a day or 24 hours. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 24 hours/a day and check if the limits is reached. Eg - Allocate 100 points to a customer from a promotion in a day. So in a day, a customer can only get 100 points from this promotion and event if the customer performs multiple events within the 24 hours duration, on every event, the system will go back and check for 24 hours.\n\nin last 7 days - Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 7 days or a week. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 7 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a week from Monday to Sunday. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 7 days and check for the limit value.\n\nin last 30 days -  Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 30 days or a month. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 30 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a month from 1st to 30th. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 30 days and check for the limit value.\n\nLimits :\n\nIndividual activity limit\n\nMax. points allocation per occurrence of activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.\n\nIndividual customer limit\n\nMax. points allocation per customer across purchases - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .\n\nMax. no. of activities per customer that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.\n\nAcross customers limit\n\nMax. points allocation across customers - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.\n\nMax. no. of activities across customers that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points across customers from the promotion. Eg - This promotion allocates to total 500 transactions.\n\nCreate Forward Cases (to Another Set)\n\nTo check multiple conditions at a time, use the Forward to Set action as explained in the following.\n\nAfter writing the rule expression , and Expression equals , set the action as Forward to Set .\n\nClick Forward to Set from the list.\n\nSet Enable lineitem unrolling? to Yes to create rules based on transaction line items. Set Enable payment method unrolling? to Yes to create rules on payment modes.\n\nTo create rules based on line-items in the forward set (set2), set Enable lineitem unroller to Yes; to create rules based on payment mode in the forward set(set2, set Enable payment method unroller to Yes.\n\nFor the lineitem unroller, you will see the Use lineitem Proportions? option. This option lets you issue points on line items based on the line item amount.\nAssume a transaction with two lineitems, where lineitem1 is $800 and lineitem2 is $1200; bill level discount is $400. Hence, the total bill amount is $1600.\nIf points allocation is set to 10% of the transaction amount, the allocation of points in the case of Use Proportions is as follows.\n\nIf Use Proportions is disabled, points of 10% will be awarded for each line item. That is 80 points for lineitem1 and 120 points for lineitem2.\n\nIf Use Proportions is enabled, points will be issued on proportionate of the bill amount. That is, for line item one - 10% of (800/2000) 1600 and for lineitem2, it will be 10% off (1200/2000) 1600.\n\nThe Maximise Points Allocation? option considers the payment methods marked as eligible under 'Advanced Settings' and allocates points for the total eligible amount when different line items earn at different rate considering the higher earning first rather than a pro-rata basis\n\nThe Maximise Points Allocation? option considers the payment methods marked as eligible under 'Advanced Settings' and allocates points for the total eligible amount when different line items earn at different rate considering the higher earning first rather than a pro-rata basis\n\nConfigure action and click Save . A new set is created.\n\nConfigure action and click Save .

They are aimed at rewarding customer loyalty and fostering repeat purchases. This is similar to the basic promotion.\n\nThese loyalty promotions are not specifically issued to individual customers instead benefits are directly provided to the customers when they meet the defined criteria. When a customer meets the requirements, the promotion is automatically applied to their transaction, resulting in the issuance of benefits such as loyalty points, tier upgrades, coupons, or badges.\n\nUse cases\n\nUse Case 1:\n\nScenario: A marketing manager aims to reward loyal customers with a tier upgrade. Configuration: The manager sets up a promotion with rules specifying that customers who make five or more purchases within a month qualify for a tier upgrade. Auto-Application: When a customer completes their fifth purchase within the designated timeframe, the system automatically applies the promotion to their transaction, elevating their tier status.\n\nUse Case 2:\n\nScenario: A marketing manager seeks to reward customers with a 10% bonus points offer during the festive season. Configuration: The manager defines a promotion with rules indicating that customers receive a 10% bonus points on each transaction based on the bill amount during the festive period. Auto-Application: A customer makes a $1000 purchase on various items. Following the configured rules, the customer earns 100 loyalty points for this transaction.\n\nUse Case 3:\n\nScenario: Encouraging Healthy Lifestyles Configuration: A wellness brand endeavors to promote healthy lifestyle choices among its customers. The marketing team creates a promotion offering 50 bonus points for every 10,000 steps walked in a day. Automatic Application: Customers who have opted into health tracking have their daily step count automatically monitored. Upon reaching the milestone of 10,000 steps in a day, the promotion is automatically applied to their account. Reward Issuance: Customers achieving the step goal receive 50 bonus points credited to their account as a reward.\n\nCreating \"Available to Issue\" loyalty promotion\n\nAttention!\n\nThe promotion type cannot be changed after creation of a promotion.\n\nCreating \"Available to Issue\" promotion is similar to creating a basic promotion type except that you must select Available to Issue from the Promotion type option. This option is not available with the basic promotion.\n\nTo create a  \"Direct Issue\" promotion, perform the following during creation of a promotion\n\nSelect Available to Issue from the Promotion type option.\n\nIn the Condition expression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\n\nIn the Add action , select the benefits that need to be provided upon meeting the criteria.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

Subsequently, upon meeting the criteria defined in the promotion during their next transaction, the benefits are provided.\n\nThe issuance of promotions occurs through various activity workflows such as TransactionAdd and Behavioral events. From a marketer's perspective, customers receive a promotion, while from the customer's perspective, they earn a promotion.\n\nUse Case 1\n\nScenario: A marketing manager targets VIP customers with a special discount. Configuration: The promotion offers a 30% discount coupon on the next purchase to VIP customers who make 3 visits to the store in 1 month. Issuance: Once a customer achieves VIP status and meets the visit milestone, the promotion is automatically issued to them. Redemption: VIP customers receive the promotion and can immediately redeem the discount on their next purchase.\n\nUse Case 2\n\nScenario: A coffee shop rewards frequent visitors with a free beverage. Configuration: The promotion provides a free beverage after every fifth visit to the store. Issuance: The system tracks customer visits and identifies those who have visited the store five times within a month. Redemption: Eligible customers receive the promotion via email or SMS and can redeem the free beverage during their next visit.\n\nUse Case 3\n\nScenario: A health app promotes hydration habits through a challenge. Configuration: Customers opt-in to the \"Hydration Challenge\" mission, which offers incentives such as bonus points and a gift card upon completion.

However, from the customer’s perspective, they receive a promotion and then earn its benefits.\n\nUse Case 1\n\nScenario: A marketing manager initiates a referral program to incentivize customers to refer friends to the platform. Upon referring their friends, customers will earn a promotion granting them 2000 bonus points and the Referral Champion badge upon their 3rd successful referral. Enrolment: Customers who have made at least three purchases in the past 6 months are enrolled in the referral program. Customer Action: Enrolled customers receive a unique referral link and are prompted to share it with friends. Issuance: When a referred friend makes their first purchase using the unique link, the referring customer earns the promotion. Upon three successful referrals, resulting in their friends' first purchases, the referring customer receives the benefits of the promotion, including 2000 bonus points and the Referral Champion badge.\n\nUse Case 2\n\nScenario: Enhancing Engagement Through Product Reviews Enrolment: A fashion retailer aims to boost customer engagement by encouraging them to write product reviews. Customers who have made a purchase within the last month are enrolled in the review program. Customer Action: Enrolled customers receive an email inviting them to write a review for their purchased product. Incentivized with a promotion offering 500 bonus points and a 10% discount coupon for their next purchase, customers are encouraged to provide feedback. Issuance: Upon submitting a review, customers are issued a promotion entitling them to 500 bonus points and a 10% discount coupon for their next purchase. Subsequently, when making their next purchase, customers receive 500 bonus points and a 10% discount on all products.\n\nUse Case 3\n\nScenario: Diabetes Wellness Challenge Targeted Enrolment: Customers with diabetes are automatically enrolled in the \"Sugar-Free Challenge\" upon joining the wellness platform. Enrolled customers receive the \"Sugar-Free Challenge\" promotion, encouraging them to abstain from added sugars for one week. Commitment and Tracking: Customers opt into the challenge, committing to avoiding added sugars daily for one week. Upon opting in, the promotion is issued to them. Achievement and Reward: Upon successfully completing the challenge, customers are rewarded with 100 bonus points as recognition of their commitment.\n\nCreating Enrol & Issue type of promotion\n\nAttention!\n\nThe promotion type cannot be changed after creation of a promotion.\n\nTo create an \"Enrol & Issue\" promotion, perform the following during the creation of a promotion\n\nSelect Enrol & issue from the Promotion type option.\n\nSelect Enrol & issue from the Promotion type option.\n\nIn the Condition expression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\n\nIn the Condition expression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\n\nSelect Add action to define the benefits (badge, coupon etc) that need to be issued to customers on meeting the criteria.\n\nSelect Add action to define the benefits (badge, coupon etc) that need to be issued to customers on meeting the criteria.\n\nClick Publish promotion .\n\nClick Publish promotion .\n\nYou can set the points allocation limit in the Advanced settings .\n\nDefining enrolment expiry\n\nThis is the duration within which a customer must complete the issuance activity for the promotion.\n\nThere are two types of expiry:\n\nAlong with promotion\n\nAfter a specific period from the customer’s enrolment\n\nAlong with promotion\n\nIn this type of expiry, the enrolment expiry remains the same as the promotion end date. For example, if the enrolment expiry is defined as the same as the promotion end date and the expiry date is 30th Apr, then a customer who is enrolled on 1st Apr can complete the issuance activity until 30th Apr, and a customer who is enrolled on 3rd Apr can complete the issuance activity until 30th Apr. The expiry remains the same for all customers in this case, irrespective of when the enrolment happened.\n\nAfter a specific period from the customer’s enrolment\n\nIn this type, the promotion expires after N number of days from the customer’s enrolment. For example, if the enrollment expiry is defined as 10 days from the customer’s enrolment, then a customer who is enrolled on 1st Apr can complete the issuance activity until 11th Apr, and a customer who is enrolled on 3rd Apr can complete the issuance activity until 13th Apr.\n\nYou can define the expiry for issued promotions under Enrolment expiry in the Advanced settings > Enrolment of the promotion.\n\nNotes\n\nThe expiries are calculated based on the store timezone.\n\nFor Enrol&Issue type of promotion, both enrolment and issual expiry will be defined If a customer is enrolled at the current time, then the expiry of the enrolment will be (current time as per the store time zone + 10 days) considering 10 days is defined as the enrolment expiry. If a customer is issued the promotion at the current time, then the expiry of the issual will be (current time as per the store time zone + 10 days) considering 10 days is defined as the issual expiry.\n\nThese expiries can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\n\nDefining limits for enrolment\n\nEnrolment restrictions are the limits set to keep restrictions on the number of times a customer can be enrolled (Backend term - Issue) in a promotion. By default, this limit is set to 1.\n\nOnly one enrolment can be active at any point in time for the customer. Suppose a customer is enrolled again in any promotion. In that case, the current enrolment will be replaced and a new expiry will be applicable for the customer based on the new enrolment date.\n\nThe maximum limit can be 100.\n\nTo set enrolment restrictions, navigate to Advanced Settings > Enrolment limit .\n\nNotes\n\nFor Enrol&Issue type of promotion, both enrolment and issual limits will be defined including issual and redemption of issual\n\nOnce the restrictions are consumed completely, there will be no more enrolment and issual that can happen for a promotion for a particular customer\n\nThese limits can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\n\nDefining issual expiry\n\nIssual expiry refers to the duration within which a customer must complete the specified activity to receive the benefits of the promotion.\n\nYou can define the expiry for issued promotions under Issual expiry in the Advanced settings of the promotion.\n\nThere are two types of expiry:\n\nAlong with promotion\n\nAfter a specific period from promotion issual\n\nAlong with promotion\n\nWhen the issual expiry is set to \"along with promotion,\" it aligns with the promotion end date. For instance, if the promotion end date is April 30th, then customers who receive the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. Similarly, customers who receive the promotion on April 3rd can also enjoy its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. In this scenario, the expiry remains consistent for all customers, regardless of when the promotion was issued.\n\nAfter specific period from promotion issual\n\nIn this, the promotion expires after a specified number of days from the time of issual. For instance, if the issual expiry is set to 10 days from promotion issual, then a customer who receives the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits by completing the activity until April 11th. Similarly, a customer who receives the promotion on April 3rd can complete the activity until April 13th to enjoy the benefits of the promotion.\n\nNotes\n\nThe expiries are calculated based on the store timezone.\n\nThese expiries can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\n\nDefining limits for issuing promotions and redemption\n\nYou can define the restrictions for the promotion issued and redemption under Issual limit in the Advanced settings .\n\nMax times a promotion can be issued to a customer (Backend term - Earn): Enter the maximum number of times a promotion can be issued to a customer. The default value is 1. Max times one issual can be redeemed : Enter the maximum number of times a single issual can be redeemed. The default value is 1.\n\nBoth issual and redemption limits can have a maximum value of 100.\n\nNotes\n\nOnce the restrictions are completely consumed, further enrolment and issual for a promotion will be unavailable for a particular customer.\n\nThese limits can be updated while the promotion is in the upcoming, live, or ended state\n\nEnroling customers for the promotion\n\nYou can enrol the customers to a promotion using the Enrol promotion API .\n\nNotes:\n\nIf the promotion is a Direct Issue, then this API call will fail as the customer can’t be enrolled in a Direct issue type of promotion.\n\nIf the promotion is of type Enrol&Issue, then this API will enrol the customer in the promotion.\n\nIssuing the promotion\n\nYou can issue the promotion through the Issue promotion action in loyalty workflows and loyalty promotions or using API.\n\nUsing Issue loyalty promotion action on UI\n\nUsing API\n\nYou can use the API Issue promotion and issue promotion.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

To enable these, contact your CSR.\n\nWhat is a Promotion priority order & stacking strategy and how are they useful?\n\nPromotion priority order (ranking promotions)\n\nPromotion Priority Order, also known as the ranking of promotions, allows brands to determine the sequence in which promotions are applied to events such as transactions or registrations. With this feature, brands can specify the order in which promotions are evaluated and applied, providing greater control over the discounts and offers presented to customers.\n\nPromotion stacking\n\nIn addition to prioritizing promotions, brands may also want to manage the number of promotions applied to a transaction, whether at the line-item level or for the entire bill, to avoid giving over-discounts. The promotion stacking feature helps limit the number of promotions applied, avoiding excessive discounts and ensuring that only the most relevant promotion is used.\n\nNote\n\nNote\n\nNote:\n\nWhen the Promotions 2.0 feature is enabled, Promotion Priority Order is automatically activated, while the stacking strategy can be enabled or disabled based on brand preferences.\n\nThe priority order and stacking strategy only evaluate promotions awarding points, i.e the promotions which have point allocation action configured within them.\n\nConfiguring promotion priority order and the type of ranking order\n\nYou can configure the promotion priority order in the Advanced settings of the loyalty program. To configure, navigate to Loyalty+ programs > Edit Program > Advance Settings > Loyalty Promotions > Promotion Priority order\n\nIn this section, you can arrange the promotion order types by dragging and dropping them to define the sequence in which promotions will be applied. You can prioritize promotions using the following order types as listed in the table below:\n\nBy default, the Priority order is  - Promotion expiry > Maximum points allocation.\n\nExample\n\nIf the priority order is set as \"Maximum points allocation\" followed by \"Promotion expiry\", then all promotions that allocate points will be ranked from highest to lowest. Subsequently, promotions will be ranked based on their expiry from earliest to farthest.\n\nFor instance, consider the below promotions:\n\nP1: Allocates 100 points, Promotion expiring in the next 30 days\n\nP2: Allocates 300 points, Promotion expiring in the next 45 days\n\nP3: Allocates 300 points, Promotion expiring in the next 20 days\n\nP4: Allocates 200 points, Promotion expiring in the next 10 days\n\nIn this scenario, the evaluation rank of promotions will be: P3 → P2 → P4 → P1.\n\nEnabling Promotion Stacking strategy\n\nYou can configure the promotion priority order in the Advanced settings of the loyalty program. To configure, navigate to Loyalty+ → Edit Program→ Advance Settings → Loyalty Promotions > Promotion Stacking Strategy .\n\nThere are two stacking strategy options available:\n\nMultiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a line-item level: Stacking for promotions which are running on a line-item level in a transaction.\n\nMultiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a transaction/bill level: Stacking for promotions which are running on the entire transaction or bill level in a transaction.\n\nWhen creating a promotion based on a transaction event, we specify whether the promotion should be applied at the line-item level or the bill level.\n\nBy default, the Stacking strategy is Off for both types of promotions.\n\nFunctionality when Stacking strategy is ON\n\nStacking on refers to the process where multiple promotions are applied within a single transaction. This is the behaviour by default but the stacking strategy helps to enable this in a controlled manner. With the stacking strategy feature, you can define a promotion as Exclusive and Non-exclusive.\n\nBenefits of marking promotion exclusive and non-exclusive\n\nWhen a promotion is marked as exclusive, it is treated as standalone and does not stack with any other promotion. The benefits allocated by the exclusive promotion, such as points or discounts, are considered independently, and the promotion's expiry date is only relevant to itself.\n\nConsider the promotions in the table below and a scenario where the priority order is set as Maximum points allocation > Promotion expiry:\n\nFirstly, P1, P2, and P3 will be stacked together, allowing them to potentially allocate a total of 700 points.  P4, being exclusive, is compared with (P1+P2+P3). Since P4 \\ Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill-level promotions: OFF\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions: OFF\n\nConclusion:\n\nStacking off ensures only a single promotion applies, prioritizing the one that allocates the maximum points.\n\nP1, marked for always application, is ensured to be applied.\n\nAdditionally, P4, which allocates the highest points, is also applied.\n\nConsequently, only P1 and P4 are applied, resulting in a total of 250 points allocated.\n\nScenario 2\n\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - OFF\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - OFF\n\nHere is the table:\n\nConclusion :\n\nWith stacking turned off, only a single promotion will be applied, prioritizing the one that allocates the maximum points.\n\nSince P1 is marked as always applied, it will be applied automatically.\n\nAmong the line-item promotions, both P2 and P3 allocate the maximum points to their respective line-items (L1 in P1 and L2 in P2), so they will both apply accordingly.\n\nAmong the bill-level promotions, P4 allocates the maximum points and will also be applied.\n\nTherefore, promotions P1, P2, P3, and P4 will be applied, resulting in a total of 570 points allocated.\n\nScenario 3\n\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\n\nConclusion:\n\nStacking: On, multiple promotions are applied in the transaction. The non-exclusive will be stacked or bundled together and the entire stack of total points will be compared with all the exclusive promotions individually.\n\nPromotions P4 and P5 will be bundled together as they are non-exclusive promotions, resulting in a stack totalling 270 points.\n\nThis stack (P4 + P5) will then be compared with each exclusive promotion individually.\n\nSince the stack's total points (270) exceed the points allocated by both P2 (120) and P3 (40) individually, the stack (P4 + P5) will be applied.\n\nAdditionally, P1, which is marked as always applied, will also be applied.\n\nTherefore, promotions P1, P4, and P5 will be applied.\n\nPoints allocated: 100 + 150 + 130\n\nScenario 4\n\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - OFF\n\nConclusion:\n\nStacking is disabled for line item level promotions, ensuring only the best promotion applies to each line item.\n\nFor bill-level promotions, stacking is enabled, allowing multiple promotions to apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\n\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\n\nAmong the line-item promotions, both P2 and P3 will apply to their respective line items, as they allocate maximum points to L1 and L2, respectively.\n\nP6 and P7, being non-exclusive promotions, will be bundled together, allocating a total of 80 points.\n\nThe stack (P6 + P7) will then be compared with P4 and P5 individually. Since the total points of the stack (80) are less than the points allocated by both P4 (150) and P5 (130) individually, P4 will apply alone as it allocates maximum points and is an exclusive promotion.\n\nTherefore, promotions P1, P2, P3, and P4 will be applied.\n\nPoints allocated: 100 + 120 + 200 + 150\n\nScenario 5\n\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - OFF\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\n\nConclusion:\n\nStacking is disabled for bill-level promotions, allowing only the best promotion to apply.\n\nFor line item level promotions, stacking is enabled, permitting multiple promotions to apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\n\nIf a single exclusive promotion allocates more points than the entire stack, it takes precedence; otherwise, the stack applies. This evaluation is performed for each line item separately.\n\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\n\nAmong the line-item promotions, for L1, both P3 and P5 will apply, as they together allocate the most points. For L2, P4 allocates the most points compared to other exclusive promotions and the stack of non-exclusive promotions.\n\nAmong the bill-level promotions, both P6 and P7 will apply.\n\nTherefore, promotions P1, P3 (for L1), P4 (for L2), P5 (for L1), and P6 will be applied.\n\nPoints allocated: 100 + 50 + 500 + 150 + 50\n\nScenario 6 :\n\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\n\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\n\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith stacking enabled, multiple promotions will apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\n\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\n\nPromotions P4, P5, and P6 are non-exclusive and will be bundled together as a stack. Together, they allocate 270 points and a coupon. This stack is compared with exclusive promotions P2 and P3 individually.\n\nThe stack (P4 + P5) allocates more points than both P2 and P3 individually.\n\nDespite P6 issuing coupons, it will also apply because the stack is elected to apply, as it allocates maximum points.\n\nTherefore, promotions P1, P4, P5, and P6 will be applied.\n\nPoints allocated: 100 + 150 + 130\n\nUse case\n\nAs a brand, I want to apply a single promotion in the transaction which allocates the maximum number of points, but along with this, I want to apply the Birthday and Anniversary promotions if some customer is eligible for these.\n\nSolution:\n\nPriority Order: Maximum Points > Earliest Expiry (To prioritize promotions allocating maximum points)\n\nStacking Strategy: Off (To ensure only a single promotion is applied)\n\nConclusion:\n\nP2 will get applied for all the customers, as it gives maximum points i.e 250. Along with this, customers who are eligible for P3 or P4 or both, will also get benefits from them, along with P2.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

This custom data can be used for various purposes such as displaying personalized information within the app or website, and for accounting or reporting purposes. Additionally, this custom data can also help brands to track and analyze the performance of their badges, and make data-driven decisions to improve their badges strategy. Furthermore, the ability to include custom data can also help brands to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to report on the performance of the badges to stakeholders.\n\nUsecase\n\nA retail brand aims to establish a badges platform to reward loyal customers and foster engagement through their mobile app. To personalize the badge experience, the brand intends to display custom information associated with each badge earned by users. To implement this the brand can perform the following:\n\nCreate a custom field named \"Terms & Conditions\" with the data type set as STRING.\n\nCreate a badge and assign this custom field \"Terms & Conditions,\" ensuring to populate it with relevant information.\n\nWhen a customer earns the badge, it will be showcased along with the \"Terms & Conditions\" field, providing users with pertinent details about the badge. Examples of custom field content may include terms and conditions, redemption instructions, brief descriptions, legal text, exclusivity status, purpose, etc.\n\nNotes\n\nCustom fields can be created, updated, or disabled.\n\nThere can be only one active custom field with the same name. If the existing custom field is disabled, then a new custom field with the same name can be created.\n\nIt is mandatory to define the default value for a custom field which is mandatory for the badge. In case a badge doesn't define a mandatory custom field with it, the default value will be considered.\n\nData types supported in custom fields: boolean, integer, string, and date.\n\nOnce the custom field is disabled, it can't be enabled again.\n\nOnly active custom fields will be returned in all the getcalls.\n\nOnly below fields can be updated while updating the custom field: Name : can be updated Isactive : can be updated from true to false but false to true is not allowed Default value can be updated Ismandatory can be updated from true to false or false to true Data type can’t be updated\n\nName : can be updated\n\nIsactive : can be updated from true to false but false to true is not allowed\n\nDefault value can be updated\n\nIsmandatory can be updated from true to false or false to true\n\nData type can’t be updated\n\nThere is no limit on the number of custom fields that can be defined at an org level for badges.\n\nCreating Custom Fields from Badges UI\n\nStart by navigating to the badges UI and go to Settings .\n\nSelect the option to Create Custom field .\n\nIn the Name field, enter a name for the custom field and from the Data type drop-down, select the appropriate data type. The supported data types are Boolean, Date, Number and String. There is no limit set on the number of characters.\n\nTo set the custom field to mandatory, set it to Yes. When a custom field is set to mandatory, it is linked to the Badges and will be part of the creation process.\n\nClick Done to finish creating the custom field.\n\nThe custom field is now successfully created.\n\nEditing a custom field\n\nCustom field can be edited by clicking on the Edit option.\n\nMake the required changes.\n\nMake the required changes.\n\nNotes\n\nWhen a mandatory field is changed to optional, it will be unlinked from all badges that previously relied on it. This means the field will no longer be required for those badges, and any validation or functionality tied to it will be removed.\n\nThe data type cannot be changed in edit mode.\n\nVerify the creation of a custom field\n\nTo verify the addition of the custom field, return to the badges UI and hover over New badges to see the option to Create a badge . Click on it.\n\nEnter the necessary information to create a badge and click Next .\n\nSelect the owner of the badge.\n\nScroll down to see the mandatory custom fields under the Custom fields section.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/grouping-and-ranking-of-badges", "title": "Grouping and Ranking of Badges", "text": "Grouping and Ranking of Badges\n\nYou can define badge groups, the rank of the group and the rank of badges even without the group tagging. This enables sorting customers' badge collections and highlighting their achievements.\n\nFor example, in the below screenshot, Limited Edition badges have a higher priority followed by Monthly challenge badges, Workout badges, and Close your Rings badges. Within each defined group, badges are sorted based on their rank.\n\nExample\n\nConsider three badge groups, Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 ranked 1, 2, and 3. While creating badges, Badge 1 is tagged with Group 1, Badge 2 is tagged with Group 2, and Badge 3 doesn't have any group tagged but has a badge rank of 1.\n\nRetrieving badges list\n\nIn the above scenario, when you retrieve the list of badges available for a customer, the system prioritizes based on the defined groups and badge ranks. Initially, the list is ordered as Badge 1, then Badge 2, and finally Badge 3 (due to the group tag of Badge 3 being null but having a rank).\n\nImpact on deleting a group\n\nIf a group is deleted the order of the badges also changes.  For example, if Group 1 is deleted, fetching the badge list will now prioritize Badge 2 first (as it belongs to Group 2), then Badge 3 (due to its rank), and finally Badge 1.\n\nThe sorting of the badges is performed using the sortOn parameter in the Get customer badge API .\n\nSorting logic:\n\nPreference will be given to the groups as per their ranking\n\nWithin the group, preference will be given to the badges for which badge rank is defined, the rest of the badges with no badge rank will be sorted in default descending order of expired date\n\nIf badges with no group are defined, they will be sorted in order of badge rank (if defined), followed by default descending order of expired date\n\nCreating a Group and Assigning a Rank to It\n\nTo create the group\n\nStart by navigating to the badges UI settings.\n\nGo to the badges UI settings.\n\nNavigate to the group section and click on \"New Group\". Here, you'll create a new group.\n\nName the group, for example, \"Summer Group\". Give your group a name.\n\nAssign a rank to the group, for example, \"4\". The rank indicates the group's priority.\n\nClick on \"Save\".\n\nYou'll see that the group is now created. You have options to edit or delete the group.\n\nTo edit the group:\n\nClick on \"Edit Group\".\n\nYou can change the group's name and rank.\n\nChange the group name, for example, to \"Summer_group_12\".\n\nChange the group rank, for example, to \"3\". This will change the group's priority.\n\nClick on \"Save\" and Save your changes to apply them.\n\nTo verify the group's creation:\n\nClick on \"Create a Badge\".\n\nIn the badge group section, you'll see the newly created group.\n\nCheck the badge group drop-down. Your new badge group, \"Summer_group_12\", appears in the drop-down. And you can now assign the badge to the group you created.\n\nBadge Group APIs\n\nYou can use the below APIs to Create, Edit, Update and Retrieve the Badge details.\n\nCreate Group\n\nUpdate Group\n\nGet Group by ID\n\nGet all Groups\n\nCreate badges with Group and Badge Rank\n\nUpdate badges with Group and Badge Rank\n\nNotes\n\nGroup name must be unique within the active groups in an org\n\nGroup rank is mandatory but there is no uniqueness on group rank\n\nBadge rank is non-mandatory\n\nGroups can be disabled by making the isActive flag false\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/retro-enrolment-and-issue-of-badges", "title": "Retro Enrolment and Issue of Badges", "text": "Retro Enrolment and Issue of Badges\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Retroactive Badge Issuance enables organizations to acknowledge and reward customers for their past transactions or actions and allows the issuing of expired badges. Example: Suppose a brand introduces a new loyalty badge called \"Gold Shopper.\" The badge is awarded to customers who have made a total purchase of $500 between Oct 1 - Oct 30th.\n\nWithout Retroactive Badge Issuance, a customer who reached the $500 threshold before the badge was introduced would not receive the \"Gold Shopper\" badge.\n\nWith Retroactive Badge Issuance, the Retroactive Badge Issuance feature allows the platform to identify customers who met the $500 threshold even before the badge was introduced. Customers who made qualifying purchases in the past say six months ago, would retroactively receive the \"Gold Shopper\" badge, acknowledging their loyalty.\n\nKey concepts:\n\nEvent Date vs. Issual Date - Retroactive badges are based on the event date (when the customer action happened), ensuring accurate recognition. The issuance date (when the badge is awarded) triggers additional rewards or perks triggered by awarding the badge.\n\nIssuance expiry : Badges expire based on the current date/processing date, not the event date.\n\nTimezone: Retroactive badge issuances consider the timezone configured at the organisational level.\n\nRestrictions: Fixed Windows badge constraint - If selected, restrictions will be checked based on the event date if fixed Windows restrictions are chosen for the badge. Rolling windows badge constraint - Restrictions based on rolling windows are not handled in retro enrolment.\n\nFixed Windows badge constraint - If selected, restrictions will be checked based on the event date if fixed Windows restrictions are chosen for the badge.\n\nRolling windows badge constraint - Restrictions based on rolling windows are not handled in retro enrolment.\n\nHandling upcoming, live and expired badges\n\nConfiguring retroactive badge issuance window\n\nYou can define the period that needs to be considered for the customer's past actions.\n\nTo define, perform the following:\n\nNavigate to Intouch > Organisation settings > Billing .\n\nDefine the below configurations: CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS : This parameter determines the maximum allowed age (in days) for retroactive transactions. For example, if the value is set to 30 days, customers can claim badges for transactions that occurred within the last 30 days from the registration date. CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS : This parameter introduces a buffer time or delay (in hours) since customer registration before they can claim retroactive badges.\n\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS : This parameter determines the maximum allowed age (in days) for retroactive transactions. For example, if the value is set to 30 days, customers can claim badges for transactions that occurred within the last 30 days from the registration date.\n\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS : This parameter introduces a buffer time or delay (in hours) since customer registration before they can claim retroactive badges.\n\nFor more information on Retro transactions, refer to the Retro transaction documentation .\n\nNote: If the badge metadata such as the end date of the badge changes, the time until which the badge can be issued retroactively will also change based on the retro configs defined at an org level. For example, if the configured retro days are 30 and the badge expiry date is extended for 10 days, the retroactive days will be calculated from this new expiry date.\n\nExample\n\nConsider a badge with the following characteristics:\n\nActive period: October 1st to 15th\n\nType: Enrol&Issue (requires both enrolment and issuance)\n\nEnrolment expiry: 2 days after enrolment\n\nBadge issuance expiry: 2 days after issuance\n\nCurrent date: October 20th\n\n``: October 10th\n\nRetro days configured to 30 days\n\nIf two badges were issued between the 10th to 12th Oct, the customer is ineligible for any further badges.\n\n- If no badge was issued between the 10th to 12th Oct, the customer will receive a badge on October 11th. |\n| Issue event date: October 20th.\n\ncustomer reports a \"badge not issued\" complaint irrespective of his/her eligibility\n\n- Restriction: Rolling window (Customer can get the badge twice in last 2 days) | - Issue instances on the current date will be checked, if two badges were issued in the previous two days,  the badge will not be issued to the customer\n\nOn 20th Oct, if only one badge was issued to the customer for the last two days, the customer will be issued one more badge\n\nOn 20th Oct, if only one badge was issued to the customer for the last two days, the customer will be issued one more badge\n\nIf on 20th Oct no badge was issued for the last 2 days, the customer will be issued one badge\n\nIf on 20th Oct no badge was issued for the last 2 days, the customer will be issued one badge\n\n- Expiry: The expiry of the badge is calculated from the current date, hence this issue will expire on 22nd Oct |\n| Issue event date: Oct 20th Customer registers on Oct 20th for loyalty | Badge not issued irrespective of eligibility. |\n\nRefer to the APIs below:\n\nEnroll customers in badges\n\nIssue badge to the customer\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

By setting limits on the number of rewards that can be purchased, brands can control the overall cost of the program and ensure that it is financially sustainable.\n\nEncourage targeted behavior: Setting limits on rewards can encourage customers to engage with the brand in a more targeted and effective way. For example, setting a limit on the number of rewards that can be purchased can encourage customers to make more frequent or larger purchases.\n\nCreate a sense of exclusivity: Setting limits on rewards can create a sense of exclusivity and scarcity, which can make the rewards more valuable and appealing to customers.\n\nPromote fairness: Setting limits on rewards can help to promote fairness among customers and ensure that the rewards are distributed fairly among all members of the loyalty program.\n\nHelp brands to evaluate the effectiveness of the program: Setting limits on rewards can help brands to evaluate the effectiveness of the loyalty program, by measuring the number of rewards purchased. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions about how to improve the program in the future.\n\nConfigurations Allowed:\n\nAs a marketing manager, you can now define the below reward limits:\n\nMax times a customer can purchase the reward in the reward duration per day per week (last 7 days) per month (last 30 days) Overall limit\n\nper day\n\nper week (last 7 days)\n\nper month (last 30 days)\n\nOverall limit\n\nMax times the reward can be purchased across customers per day per week (last 7 days) per month (last 30 days) Overall limit\n\nper day\n\nper week (last 7 days)\n\nper month (last 30 days)\n\nOverall limit\n\nSet limit as 0 : Support KPI value 0. User can set this 0 any time\n\nUpdate reward restrictions at any time\n\nRemove restrictions at any time\n\nAudit logs for all updates in reward constraints\n\nKPI Terms\n\nLevel Customer Level - Only impacts particular customer Reward Level - Impacts all customers of the reward\n\nKPI Quantity - Number of rewards of the same type being bought.\n\nRepeatFrequencyType Currently only 3 repeat frequencies are considered. DAY MONTH WEEK\n\nDAY\n\nMONTH\n\nWEEK\n\nInterval The interval for which repeat frequency has to be considered. example: Last 3 weeks, last 2 days.\n\nValidations\n\nNo validation on limits, i.e limit can be any number from 1 to MAX\n\nIf multiple restrictions with the same KPI and repeatFrequencyType are passed for a particular level, the value will be replaced with the latest value.\n\nExample :\n\nThe final value of this KPI will be limit 20 and interval of 30\n\nGet started here,\n\nThis feature is not yet available on UI, refer to the below API documentations:\n\nCreate Reward Update Reward Get Brand Rewards\n\nPoints to Note\n\nIf no consumption restriction is added the reward will always be available for issual, i.e unlimited availability.\n\nThe repeat frequency types are always considered rolling, time frames will be calculated with respect to the current date and set duration interval.\n\nAny one or all of repeat frequency types (such as per day, per week, per month) can be configured at every consumption restriction level of the reward.\n\nAdding constraints on an expired reward is not allowed.\n\nAdding the reward restrictions post the reward is live can result in users breaching the reward constraint. For example, Day 1 10:00 AM : User 1 purchased 5 qty of Reward1 Day 1  01:00 PM : On Reward1,  Customer level constraints are added, KPI-Quantity, limit = 2, freq=DAYS, interval = 1 Day 1  02:00 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action. Day 1  02:30 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action. Day 1  02:40 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will not allow this action as the customer level limit only allows 2 qty and this call fails.\n\nDay 1 10:00 AM : User 1 purchased 5 qty of Reward1\n\nDay 1  01:00 PM : On Reward1,  Customer level constraints are added, KPI-Quantity, limit = 2, freq=DAYS, interval = 1\n\nDay 1  02:00 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action.\n\nDay 1  02:30 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action.\n\nDay 1  02:40 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1.

When they log into the rewards catalog, they should only see rewards relevant to the specific loyalty program associated with the card used for purchases. By filtering rewards based on program IDs, brands can ensure that customers are presented with rewards applicable to their current loyalty program membership, providing a more personalized and relevant experience.\n\nCreating Targeted Rewards for Loyalty Program Members: A brand can create a reward specifically for customers who hold a certain credit card and are members of a particular loyalty program. By mapping rewards to specific loyalty programs, brands ensure that the reward is visible only to customers who meet these criteria, enhancing the perceived value of the reward and fostering exclusivity.\n\nCustomized Redemption: By mapping loyalty program IDs and tiers, brands can offer personalized rewards based on a customer’s loyalty status. Higher-tier customers may receive exclusive or premium rewards, while lower-tier customers are presented with rewards suited to their level.\n\nTargeted Promotions: Mapping loyalty program IDs and tiers enables brands to execute targeted promotions. Specific rewards can be offered to customers based on their loyalty program participation, driving engagement and encouraging higher-tier customers to maintain their loyalty.\n\nSupplementary Program Integration: Mapping loyalty program IDs to the rewards catalog allows for integration with supplementary programs. For instance, if a brand partners with an airline, it can map the loyalty program IDs of customers who are also frequent flyers, offering rewards such as discounted or complimentary flights.\n\nPersonalized Rewards Based on Customer Groups: Sarah is a loyal customer who enjoys browsing her favorite brand's rewards catalog. She belongs to two special customer groups: \" Frequent Shoppers \" and \"Premium Members .\" Rewards Available:\n\nReward R1: Designed for customers in the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Summer Sale\" groups.\n\nReward R2: For those in the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Premium Members\" groups.\n\nReward R3: For the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Early Access\" groups.\n\nReward R4: Available to all customers, without any specific group requirements.\n\nWhen Sarah logs into the rewards catalog, she expects to see only the rewards that are relevant to her. Since she is in the \"Premium Members\" group, she sees:\n\nRewards Shown: R2, R4\n\nRewards Hidden: R1, R3 (because she isn’t in the \"Summer Sale\" or \"Early Access\" groups)\n\nThis personalized experience makes Sarah feel valued and ensures she only sees rewards she can redeem.\n\nReward Experience for a Non-Customer Group Member: Emma has not joined any specific customer groups, but she is still an important customer to the brand.

These features empower users to curate customized catalogs that effectively showcases rewards to their audience, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nGrouping Rewards:\n\nGrouping rewards allows brands to categorize them into distinct sections based on common themes, types, or purposes. This feature enables users to create a structure within their reward catalog, making it easier for customers to navigate and find relevant rewards. For example, rewards can be grouped into categories such as \"Featured Rewards,\" \"Exclusive Offers,\" or \"Seasonal Rewards.\"\n\nRanking Rewards:\n\nRanking rewards enables brands to assign ranks for reward groups as well as ranks for the individual rewards in that group. By assigning ranks, brands can ensure that the most relevant or valuable rewards are prominently displayed to customers. This feature allows brands to highlight specific rewards or promotions based on their strategic objectives or user preferences. For instance, brands can prioritize certain reward groups assigning them higher ranks and can also prioritize rewards within a group.\n\nWhat's New\n\nMultiple Group Tagging: Link a single reward to multiple groups.\n\nGroup-Specific Ranks: Define ranks for rewards within each group.\n\nOptional Features: Group tagging and rank assignment are optional and independent of individual reward ranks.\n\nEnhanced API Responses: Return detailed group tags and ranks in API responses.\n\nBenefits:\n\nEnhanced User Experience: Grouping and ranking rewards create a more organized and user-friendly catalog, making it easier for customers to browse and engage with rewards.\n\nEffective Promotion: By highlighting specific rewards through grouping and ranking, users can drive attention to key rewards or offers, increasing customer engagement and conversion rates.\n\nImproved Navigation: Grouping rewards into categories and ranking them based on priority streamlines the browsing experience for customers, helping them find relevant rewards more efficiently.\n\nFor example, in the below screenshot, Recommended Products have a higher priority than Home & Kitchen Category. Within each defined group, rewards are sorted based on their rank.\n\nUse Cases\n\nFlexible Reward Tagging: Mark a reward with multiple groups and define ranks within each group to showcase rewards effectively.\n\nExample: Reward 1 is tagged with Group 1 (Rank 1) and Group 2 (Rank 3). When fetching rewards for Group 1, Reward 1 appears first due to its higher rank within the group.\n\nIndividual Rank Sorting: When fetching rewards with sortOnRank=true, sort by individual rank first. If no rank is defined, use the creation date.\n\nExample: Reward 1 (Rank 1) appears before Reward 2 (Rank 2) when sorted by individual rank, followed by rewards with no rank sorted by creation date.\n\nGroup-Specific Sorting: When fetching rewards for a particular group, sort based on the rank within that group. Rewards without a defined rank in the group will follow default sorting.\n\nExample: For Group 2, sort as Reward 2 (Rank 2), Reward 1 (Rank 3), and Reward 5 (Rank 4).\n\nDefault Sorting: If no group or rank is defined, sort rewards by creation date.\n\nExample: Rewards not tagged to any group are sorted by creation date, with more recent rewards appearing first.\n\nExample Scenario\n\nGroups Defined:\n\nGroup 1: Rank 1\n\nGroup 2: Rank 2\n\nGroup 3: Rank not defined\n\nRewards:\n\nReward 1: Group 1 (Rank 1), Group 2 (Rank 3); Created March 1; Individual Rank 1\n\nReward 2: Group 1 (Rank 2); Created March 2; Individual Rank 2\n\nReward 3: Group 1 (No rank); Created March 3; Individual Rank not defined\n\nReward 4: Group 3 (No rank); Created March 1; Individual Rank 3\n\nReward 5: Group 2 (Rank 4), Group 3 (No rank); Created March 4; Individual Rank 4\n\nReward 6: No group; Created March 1; Individual Rank not defined\n\nReward 7: No group; Created March 3; Individual Rank not defined\n\nRetrieving Rewards:\n\nWith sortOnRank=true: Order by individual rank first.\n\nOrder: Reward 1, Reward 2, Reward 4, Reward 5, Reward 3, Reward 6\n\nFor Group 1:\n\nOrder: Reward 1 (Rank 1), Reward 2 (Rank 2), Reward 3 (No rank)\n\nFor Group 2:\n\nOrder: Reward 2 (Rank 2), Reward 1 (Rank 3), Reward 5 (Rank 4)\n\nFor Group 3:\n\nOrder: Reward 5 (No rank), Reward 4 (No rank), Reward 5 appears first due to recent creation date.\n\nNo Group:\n\nOrder: Reward 7 (Created March 3), Reward 6 (Created March 1)\n\nPoints to Note:\n\nGroup: Group names must be unique and non-null.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/pointscash-journeys-in-rewards-catalog", "title": "Different payment modes for rewards in the catalog", "text": "Different payment modes for rewards in the catalog\n\nBrands can now expand their rewards catalog to include options to purchase rewards with cash, fixed points, variable points, or a combination of both, providing customers with greater flexibility and more reasons to engage with the loyalty program. With options including FREE, POINTS, CASH, CONV_RATIO and POINTS_CASH, brands gain enhanced flexibility and control over reward issuance.\n\nThis feature enables customers to receive a reward either by redeeming their points or by making a cash payment or both. Cash transactions or any other mode of payment occur outside the system and are not subject to validation within the system.\n\nThe supported payment modes are:\n\nFREE: This payment mode incurs zero cost, requiring neither points nor cash.\n\nPOINTS: Loyalty points are redeemed from the customer's wallet to issue the reward.\n\nCASH: The reward is issued without redemption or validation, assuming the tender transaction occurred outside the system (upstream system).\n\nPOINTS_CASH: In this payment mode, the system issues rewards based on redeeming both cash and loyalty points from the customer's wallet. The assumption here is that the cash transaction has been completed successfully, and the reward is issued based solely on this external transaction.\n\nCONV_RATIO: The rewards system calculates the equivalent miles based on the points provided in the issue reward request basis the conversion ratio of the reward. For example: If the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants to burn 1500 points and the same points worth of miles need to be credited to his account, the rewards system calculates miles worth 1500 points based on the conversion ratio value i.e. 1500*0.44 = 660 miles If the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants 1000 miles to be credited. The reward system calculates the points to be redeemed i.e. 1000/0.44= 2272 points will be deducted.\n\nIf the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants to burn 1500 points and the same points worth of miles need to be credited to his account, the rewards system calculates miles worth 1500 points based on the conversion ratio value i.e. 1500*0.44 = 660 miles\n\nIf the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants 1000 miles to be credited. The reward system calculates the points to be redeemed i.e. 1000/0.44= 2272 points will be deducted.\n\nDefining multiple payment modes for a single reward : Offer rewards with multiple payment options, giving customers the flexibility to choose their preferred payment method. For example, Customers can get the cinema ticket either in 16,000 Points OR 10,000 ShowPoints + $72 Customers can get the merchandise in 1000 points OR 500 points + 5$ or 10$\n\nCustomers can get the cinema ticket either in 16,000 Points OR 10,000 ShowPoints + $72\n\nCustomers can get the merchandise in 1000 points OR 500 points + 5$ or 10$\n\nDuring the issue call, the system records the payment mode used to issue the reward at the reward level.\n\nValidations\n\nIf payment config is not set, type is not FREE_VOUCHER and intouchPoints is 0, an exception will be thrown saying either define the points greater than 0 or type should be FREE_VOUCHER\n\nCONV_RATIO mode is supported only for CHARITY, MILES, CASH_WALLET, AUCTION, PHYSICAL_REWARD, GIFT_CARD, SWEEPSTAKES type of redemption types.\n\nIf type is FREE_VOUCHER and payment mode is set then, it will be FREE i.e. no points will be deducted.\n\nMaximum of 5 mode of payments can be added against a single reward\n\nExcept free mode of payment and conversion ratio, all the other mode of payments can be combined as the user will never say that reward is free as well as can be bought with 500 points or 10$ cash.\n\nNote:-\n\nNew brands should no longer use the \"intouch points\" field. Instead, they should only use the new \"payment config\" block in Create and Update reward API\n\nAPI documentation\n\nCreate Reward with payment configs\n\nUpdate Reward with payment configs\n\nConversion ratio (CONV_RATIO)\n\nPOINTS\n\nCASH\n\nPoints and cash (POINTS_CASH)\n\nFREE\n\nWith Multiple Payment modes\n\nFollowing get APIs will return the payment config details Get user specific reward by id Get reward details by id Get issued reward details for a user Get all available rewards for user\n\nGet user specific reward by id\n\nGet reward details by id\n\nGet issued reward details for a user\n\nGet all available rewards for user\n\nIssue reward API now accepts payment config and tender blocks for recording cash based transactions for audit and reporting purposes.\n\nUse cases:\n\nA brand, ABC, wants to allow customers to purchase rewards using combination of points and cash rather than allowing customers to purchase rewards using only points. To achieve this, define the payment mode as POINTS_CASH`and issue the reward.\n\nConcert Ticket Purchase: The customer had options to pay with 10,000 points, 5,000 points + $50, or $100, and chose 5,000 points + $50 to secure the ticket.\n\nHotel Stay Redemption: The member could redeem a hotel stay with 20,000 points, 15,000 points + $100, or $250, and opted for 15,000 points + $100.\n\nElectronics Purchase: The customer had the choice to use 30,000 points, 25,000 points + $150, or $300, and decided on 25,000 points + $150 for the tablet.\n\nAirline Ticket Redemption: The frequent flyer could book the flight with 40,000 points, 30,000 points + $200, or $500, and chose 30,000 points + $200.\n\nCharity Donation: The customer had options to donate using 5,000 points, 3,000 points + $20, 1,000 points + $30, 2,000 points + $25, or $50, and selected 3,000 points + $20.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

They would like to know the number of countries now and where the brand will be by the end of the year.  Also, how many game experiences per person the brand anticipates.  For example, Todd would only have one “campaign/game” to play at any given moment. Cataboom will be able to give the full pricing picture after that. Required information:\n\nExpected player base with certain growth projections\n\nNumber of games the brand would want to implement\n\nHow does the integration take place and how much time it requires?\n\nWebhook URL / behavioral events integration with middle layer. 3-4 mandays of effort. Coupon issual is at our end. So far, our integration supports lead capture (acquisition campaign) and customer retention activities and issue of coupons from our end.\n\nHow are the games integrated on the mobile app?\n\nCataboom <-> App: web link URL, via iFrame for mobile app\n\nWhat is the lead time to launch a game?\n\n4-5 days, Majority of the time is spent on designing the artwork of games.\n\nWho will create the gamification artwork for brands?\n\nBrand itself or the CSMs\n\nHow will the customization of games happen?\n\nFor advanced game setups - Cataboom will map a dedicated POC and generally the SLA here will depend on the requirement\n\nWhat are the reports generated from the data generated from game plays and where is the reporting available, on Cataboom platform or on Capillary platform?\n\nYou can get some basic numbers - Number of Plays, Unique plays from Cataboom\n\nPoints allocated for the corresponding promotion can be extracted from Insights+\n\nBrand gets all the promotion data from capillary as a part of daily feed.\n\nWhat is the measurement of success for gamification?\n\nKey KPI is engagement. This means the number of customers who played the game, how many times they played the game. If the game is tied to any objective such as acquisition, re-activation, cross-sell etc. the brand can see if the campaign impacted those KPIs.\n\nHow will the production  bugs be taken care of?\n\nThese will be raised directly to [email protected]\n\nCataboom will share the governance doc and escalation matrix\n\nCan the marvel rewards be issued when a customer wins the game?\n\nBrands can issue 100% off coupons and customers can use those coupons to get the free products.\n\nCan games be issued to a particular segment of customers? For example, only top tier customers will see the game on the app and no other person will see the game.\n\nIssuance of games to specific customers is not possible today, this will be an enhancement at Capillary’s end and will be available after 2 quarters. But, the brands can use the metadata related to their customers to match the metadata at cataboom’s end and show the games only to customers where this metadata matches.\n\nCan one behavioral event be used for setting up multiple games if the attributes are same?\n\nAt different times yes, not at the same time. But now you can set up multiple behavioral events and link them to the promotions.\n\nIs middle layer setup required every time a new game is set up as the event_name will be changed with each game or will it be the same in every game?\n\nNow with the new enhancement in behavioral events, middle layer is not required.\n\nSample Games\n\nCatch the shoes and win: https://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-burrow-game\n\nScratch and win: https://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-scratchandwin\n\nSpin the wheel: https://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-spinthewheel\n\nCatch the planes Belavia Game: https://secure.cataboom.com/direct/airline\n\nQuick play: https://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-quick-play\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

Here, you can set up the API configurations.\n\nGamification supports third party APIs as well.\n\nBasic details:\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nReward/Redemption Type (Custom metadata) VOUCHER POINTS PHYSICAL_VOUCHER\n\nVOUCHER\n\nPOINTS\n\nPHYSICAL_VOUCHER\n\nAPI:\n\napiUrl\n\napiType\n\napiResponseExtractKey\n\napiBody\n\napiHeaders\n\napiQueryParameters\n\nLanguage\n\nYou can add languages at org level and these languages can be added for all games set up for the org.\n\nAPIs:\n\nThere are 2 user facing APIs:\n\nAPI to allocate games : Games need to be issued for the customer to play it\n\nAPI to play the game\n\nDB:\n\nFor each game, there will be a different gameID\n\nAllowed_play vs max_play_allowed : max_play_allowed is how many times a customer can play the game. Each allocation allows the user to play the game only once. Allowed play is how many times a game is allocated to the customer.\n\nFAQs:\n\nGame is still running, but the rewards have been exhausted. What will happen in that case?\n\nThere can be multiple approaches here:\n\nYou can remove the game item if it is consumed completely OR\n\nDisable the game and it will no longer be available to play OR\n\nChange the reward linked to the particular game item\n\nCan you edit a game once it is live?\n\nYes, the game can be edited post it is live\n\nCan the sum of winning probability be >100% as the UI allows to create it?\n\nYes, it can be more than 100%. Let's say there are 2 line items, with 50% and 70% winning probability. Gamification makes a big number out of it(Eg: 50_500(25000), 70_500(35000)) and get a random number between 1 and 60000(25000+35000=60000). For 1-25000, this is for Item1 For 25001-60000, this for Item2\n\nSo there is no harm to keep winning probability more than 100%\n\nCan you edit an expired game?\n\nNo, expired games can't be edited\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

You can create a campaign for different marketing objectives, such as Sales promotion, New Store opening, Brand anniversary, Birthday, and many others.\n\nReach your customers by running campaigns over emails, SMS, social media, and in-store outlets via bulk or trigger messages. Capillary's campaign manager is also powered by customer analytics which helps in creating significant and personalized email/SMS campaigns and generating campaign reports.\n\nThis overview walks you through the Engage+ interface to help you begin.\n\nCampaign overall performance dashboard\n\nShows the overall performance of campaigns for the last 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.\n\nFor more information refer to the documentation view campaign reports .\n\nCampaign listing interface\n\nSearch Campaign : Enter the campaign name in the search box.\n\nFilters campaigns by duration : Click the calendar icon to enter the duration in Start date and End date .\n\nOU Filter : Filter campaigns created for different org units.\n\nFilter campaigns by status, marketing objective, and/or created by : Click on the filters icon for advanced filters, choose the desired options, and click Apply .\n\nCampaign status : Select Campaign status and choose from the following options.\n\nLive Shows: ongoing campaigns.\n\nUpcoming: Shows future campaigns.\n\nLapsed: Shows the past or inactive campaigns.\n\nMarketing Objective : The marketing objective is an option to define the purpose of your campaign. For example, Boost sales, Acquire customers, Promote specific products, and so on. To know more about marketing objectives, see Marketing Objective .\n\nCreated by :  This option allows you to filter campaigns created by a specific user. Select the user in the drop-down box.\n\nHow engage+ is different from loyalty+\n\nLoyalty promotions are based on customer activities, meaning a customer earns incentives upon performing a specific activity. For example, earning 2x points on a transaction during their birthday month or receiving 100 points for completing a running milestone.\n\nEngage promotions primarily focus on issuing incentives in bulk and delivering them through broadcast campaigns. For instance, issuing 100 points and sending an email to all customers with a birthday this month. These do not require the customer to perform any specific activity.\n\nEngage also includes additional types of promotions:\n\nDVS (Dynamic Voucher System): Similar to loyalty promotions, these are activity-based, where customers earn incentives upon performing an activity. However, DVS promotions exclusively issue vouchers as incentives. These are typically used by brands not utilising loyalty promotions, as loyalty promotions offer a more comprehensive solution.\n\nReferral campaigns - Referral campaigns help acquire new customers by leveraging the networks of existing customers. Incentives for these campaigns can include coupons or points and can be configured to reward both the referrer and the referee. Rewards are typically based on specific actions, such as completing a registration or making a transaction.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/common-filter-optionsin-filters", "title": "Common Filter Options (in filters)", "text": "Common Filter Options (in filters)\n\nAs mentioned in the previous articles, there are different ways of creating an audience group. One way is to generate using filters, second way is by directly uploading customer identifiers, and the third way is to merge two existing groups. The last two ways are very straight forward.\n\nAs filters provide a more efficient way of targeting and is also powered by AI, you can create a more specific audience group with numerous options that are available in each filter .\n\nThis article provides detailed information on common options available in most of the filters\n\nDate filter\n\nConsiders activity of a customer during a specified duration. Activity refers to transactions, registration, coupon redemption or any other interaction of the customer with the brand. You can choose duration either by specific dates or relative days. To not apply any date filter, you can use Lifetime.\n\nLifetime\n\nConsiders activities from the time the customer enrolled in the loyalty program.\n\nSpecific dates\n\nConsiders activities during a specific date range. The following sub-options are available for specific dates:\n\nBefore : To consider the activities recorded before a specific date.\n\nAfter : To consider the activities from a specific date.\n\nBetween dates : To consider the activities during a specific date range (X to Y).\n\nRelative days\n\nConsiders activities based on the relative days, weeks (Mon-Sun) or months.(1-30/31) You can set the duration relative to the current date. For example, last 9 days, next 2 weeks.\n\nThe following options are available for relative days:\n\nIn the last x :  Fetches customers who interacted with your brand in the last x days, weeks or months. For example, if you set 10 in the last x calendar week, you will get customers who interacted in the last ten weeks.\n\nIn the next x : Fetches customers who will interact with your brand in the next x days, weeks or months. For example, if you set 1 in the next x calendar week,  you will get customers who purchased a specific product(s) in the upcoming calendar week.\n\nIn the current x : Fetches customers who interacted with your brand on the current day, week or month.\n\nBetween days :  Fetches customers who  interacted with your brand between 'the last x days’ and 'the next y days'. For example, last 30 days until the next 15 days.\n\nExactly x days ago : Fetches customers who  interacted with your brand x days ago. For example, you can get the customers who made registration 10 days ago.\n\nExactly after x days : Fetches customers who will interact with your brand after x days from the current day. For example, you can get the customers who will purchase men's trousers on the 10th day from now. 1 is for tomorrow, 2 for the day after tomorrow and so on or you can get customers who will redeem coupons on the 4th day from now.\n\nStore hierarchy\n\nThis option lets you filter customers by store(s) at which the activity is done. You can also select stores by zones and concepts. The activity could be customer registration, points/coupon redemption, profile update, etc.\n\nStore\n\nYou can filter customers by store(s) at which they performed a specific activity and select them using any of the following options:\n\nUpload list : Lets you upload store IDs using a CSV file. Select the upload list from the drop-down list. If you do not have the CSV file, then download the sample CSV file, add store IDs, and upload it.\n\nEnter values : Let's you search for stores manually. On the search box, enter a store name, and select the store name from the suggested list. You can add multiple stores.\n\nBased on attributes : Let you select store(s) based on attributes. You can select stores by attributes such as store name, type, store external ID, area, and more. You can select multiple attributes. Once you select store attributes, select the values of each attribute from the available list. For example, to filter stores by city, select the store city from the attributes list, and in the store city list, select your preferred city name.\n\nZone/ Concept\n\nA zone is a geographical cluster of stores. A concept is a logical grouping of stores.You can filter customers by zones/concepts in which the customer performed a specific activity.  You can select stores of one or more zones/concepts using the following options:\n\nAny store : Selects all the stores of a selected zone(s)/ concept(s).\n\nStores with attributes : Use this to select stores by store attributes of the specified zone(s) concept(s). Store attributes could be store channel, store type, external ID, store area, store name, and more. Once you choose a store attribute, select the values for each shop attribute from the recommended list. For example, to filter stores of a concept by city, choose the store city from the list of attributes, then choose your preferred city name from the store city list.\n\nPoints\n\nActive points\n\nPoints that are available for a customer for redemption are active points. You can use points range to get customers that have current points in a particular range. You can either include or exclude customers for a given condition.\n\nGreater than equal : Get customers that have current points greater than or equal to the value specified here\n\nLess than equal : Get customers that have current points less than or equal to the value  specified here\n\nEquals : Get customers that have a specific number of current points In range of:  Get customers whose current points are between a specific range (including minimum points to maximum points). For example, 200-500 includes customers that have active points greater than equal to 200 and less than equal to 500.\n\nExpired points:\n\nPoints that are no longer available for redemption are expired points.\n\nThe following are the basic or mandatory options available for expired points.\n\nGreater than equal : Include/exclude customers whose number of points getting expired are more than the number specified herein.\n\nLess than equal : Include/exclude customers whose number of points getting expired are less than the number specified herein.\n\nEquals : Include/exclude customers with the exact number of points getting expired In the range of:  Include/exclude customers whose expiring points are in a specific range (Min points to Max points).\n\nThe advanced options available for expired points are Date, Promotion Name, Promotion Type, Points awarded type.\n\nLifetime points\n\nThe total number of points issued to a customer over the time he/she got associated with your brand till date.\n\nGreater than equal : Include or exclude customers whose lifetime points are greater than or equal to the value you specify here.\n\nLess than equal : Include or exclude customers whose lifetime points are less than or equal to the value you specify here.\n\nEquals : Include or exclude customers who have a specific lifetime points.\n\nIn range : Include or exclude customers whose lifetime points are in a specific range including the specified points (minimum points to maximum points).\n\nLead status\n\nCurrent lead status\n\nGet customers by current lead status. You can select multiple statuses. For example, customers whose leads are currently Open or On hold.\n\nThe following are the standard statuses for leads. However, an org can create custom statuses as required.\n\nOpen : This is usually used for new leads that are not processed.\n\nWon : This is used for leads that are successfully converted.\n\nLost : This is used for leads that are not converted in a specific period. There is a config, CONF_LEAD_AUTO_CLOSURE_TIME_PERIOD , in InTouch Settings > Miscellaneous > Lead Configuration . If a lead is not converted within that duration, the status is marked as Lost automatically.\n\nOn hold : This is used when the item the customer has given a timeline to decide on or the item is not available in the store currently.\n\nDeleted : This is usually used for unqualified or invalid leads.\n\nChannel\n\nLet you build an audience group based on their mobile number and email subscription status - Opt-in or Opt-out.\n\nEmail : Use this to get customers that registered their email id\n\nMobile : Use this to get customers that registered their mobile number\n\nWeb Engage : Use this to get customers that are subscribed to mobile push notifications\n\nLine : You can get customers that are registered in the brand's Line account\n\nEcommerce : Use this to get customers that are on the e-commerce platform of the brand\n\nWeChat : You can get customers that are registered in the brand's official WeChat account. WeChat is a communication channel like WhatsApp used in countries like China\n\nNDNC status\n\nLet you build an audience group based on NDNC (National Do Not Disturb) status, NDNC , Invalid , DND , and Unknown . You can select more than one option.\n\nStatus\n\nNDNC : The abbreviation of the National Do Not Call Registry is the NDNC Registry that controls unsolicited communications. Might not be applicable to all countries\n\nDND : Customers that do not want to receive any unsolicited SMS or calls will register in Do Not Disturb (DND). You can get customers who registered their mobile numbers in DND. Might not be applicable to all countries.\n\nInvalid : Customers with invalid mobile numbers.\n\nUnknown : Customers whose status is currently unknown.\n\nNot captured : Customers whose status data are not captured.\n\nFraud\n\nMarked : A customer who has shown fraudulent behavior, but has yet to confirm by our team.\n\nConfirmed :  A customer was confirmed as a fraud (from the status \"marked\") by our team.\n\nReconfirmed : A confirmed fraud customer that has shown the fraudulent behavior again\n\nNot fraud : A customer that has shown a fraudulent behavior, but later our team has confirmed as not fraud\n\nInternal : Internal Capillary users that make transactions and other activities for testing purposes.\n\nNot applicable : The standard field is applicable for all the organizations; whenever the organization does not pass information collected from the customers, the system considers it not applicable. For example,  let us take the first name field in the user table. This is a standard field and most brands capture the first name of customers who are registered and passed into the Capillary system. However, if a brand does not capture and pass the customer's first name into the Capillary system (if there is no first name-value present in the customer's first name field in source data), the value in the first name field of the user table will show not applicable.\n\nInvalid : The source dimension attribute values are predefined in the system; whenever any value other than the predefined values is passed to the Capillary system, the system considers it invalid. For example, a specific brand has source dimension attributes with fixed values - Instore, Web_engage, App, and WeChat. Here, Facebook is not a pre-configured source dimension attribute. Therefore, if any customer gets registered via Facebook, and this source value is passed into the system, the system will not recognize it (Facebook). And the value for this dimension is invalid.\n\nNote\n\nSource dimension refers to the channel via which a customer registered with the brand.\n\nNot captured : The information that the brand collects from the customer during a transaction is entered into the Capillary system; whenever the brand passes null instead of this transaction information, the system considers it not captured. Let's take the same example mentioned in invalid status. If the client system fails to capture the channel (INSTORE, Web_Engage, App, or WeChat) where a customer is registered and passes a null value, the Capillary system saves the source dimension attribute value as not captured.\n\nFor more details on fraud tagging, fraud detection methodologies, fraud detection report execution in Essential Insights, and other fraud-related details refer to the attached PDF document.\n\nProduct filter\n\nThis lets you filter customers by products purchased. The following are the different options available for this filter.\n\nCategory : Fetches customers who purchase products from specific category(s). You can further filter the results using the following options: any product : Filter any product from the selected category(s). products with these attributes :    Filter products based on attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and more.\n\nCategory : Fetches customers who purchase products from specific category(s). You can further filter the results using the following options:\n\nany product : Filter any product from the selected category(s).\n\nany product : Filter any product from the selected category(s).\n\nproducts with these attributes :    Filter products based on attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and more.\n\nproducts with these attributes :    Filter products based on attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and more.\n\nFiltering using category\n\nSub-Category : Fetches customers who shopped products of a specific sub-category(s). You can further filter the results using the following options: any product : Filter any product from the selected category(s). products with these attributes :    Filter products based on attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and more.\n\nany product : Filter any product from the selected category(s).\n\nproducts with these attributes :    Filter products based on attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and more.\n\nFiltering using sub-category\n\nItem Code : Fetches customers who purchased a specific item.  You can choose the item codes through one of the following methods:\n\nFiltering using item code\n\nupload list : Use this option to upload a CSV file containing the item codes for filtering. Click Choose File to upload the CSV.\n\nUploading a csv file\n\nenter values : Use this option to fetch the item codes manually.\n\nbased on attributes : Use this option to filter customers by product attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and so on.\n\nUpdated 2 months ago"}
{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-audience-group", "title": "Create Audience Group", "text": "Create Audience Group\n\nAudience filters help you create specific audience groups based on customer behavior, purchase history, preferences, and other attributes. By using these filters, you can segment your audience more accurately and deliver personalized communication that drives better results.\n\nThere are three ways of creating audience groups -\n\nApply filter conditions (using audience filters)\n\nUpload CSV file\n\nUse existing groups.\n\nImport via FTP connector\n\nCreate audience group using audience filters\n\nFilters facilitate the effectiveness of a campaign by targeting the right customers in the right context. You can build an audience group based on specific information in a certain period. The information could be on behavior, interests, demographic details, transactions, and more. For example, you can get high spending customers that did not visit your stores for the last three months.\n\nWith filters you can :\n\nCreate  audience groups using various predefined filters such as transactions, customer details, demographics, custom field details, and loyalty informatio. For more information audience filters refer to About audience group filters documentation.\n\nOptimize a group using multiple filters to get a specific intended customer list. For example, you can build an audience group that purchased during Dec 1, 2021 - Jan 31, 2022 with marital status married.\n\nYou can either use and/or operators between two filters.\n\nYou can reuse an audience list in other campaigns.\n\nThis section focuses only on creating an audience list through filters (Apply filter condition).\n\nTo create an audience group through filters:\n\nWhen creating campaigns, after creating the message type and click Next\n\nClick Add audience group > Create audience group\n\nSpecify a name for the filter group.\n\nIn Loyalty program/Card series, choose the scope of the audience from the list of loyalty programs or card series. You will see this option only for MLP-enbaled orgs.\n\nSelect the Apply filter condition and click Next\n\nAll customers will be selected by default.  You will see the count of customers on the right as highlighted in the screenshot above\n\nDefine your Customer Base : You need to define your customer base on which you want to apply filters. You can select all customers or customers of your preferred segments. You can do another round of filtering on the basis of loyalty status. Any filter that you apply will be on the selected customer base\n\nAcross Org or Specific Org Unit : You can choose customers at the org level or filter customers of a specific org unit. To select org unit, on the header, click on the OU drop-down and select the desired OU. All is for the entire org\n\nAcross Org or Specific Org Unit : You can choose customers at the org level or filter customers of a specific org unit. To select org unit, on the header, click on the OU drop-down and select the desired OU. All is for the entire org\n\nAll Customers or Select segments : You can either select all customers which is a default option or select customers from specific segments. Click on the respective edit option to select the desired option. For more information, see Select customers of Specific Segments.\n\nAll Customers or Select segments : You can either select all customers which is a default option or select customers from specific segments. Click on the respective edit option to select the desired option. For more information, see Select customers of Specific Segments.\n\nLoyalty Status :  You can also include or exclude customers of a specific loyalty status - loyalty customers, non-loyalty customers, and non-registered customers using the Loyalty Status field. For more information, see Select Customers of a Specific Loyalty status.\n\nLoyalty Status :  You can also include or exclude customers of a specific loyalty status - loyalty customers, non-loyalty customers, and non-registered customers using the Loyalty Status field. For more information, see Select Customers of a Specific Loyalty status.\n\nWrite Filter Conditions : Once you have selected the required customer base, you can apply filters to get a very specific list that is needed. Use multiple filters to get your required customers from the combination of multiple filters or customers that satisfy any of the configured conditions. For example, you can get all customers who are in gold slab and their lifetime purchase value is more than $10000 using AND operator. For more information, see Using Multiple Filters\n\nCategory\n\nDescription\n\nLoyalty\n\nLets you build audience groups with loyalty behavior such as active points, expired points, redeemed points, current tier, registered store, registered date, demographic details, and tier migration.\n\nTransaction\n\nLets you build an audience group based on purchases, returns, and recently purchased products or categories.\n\nFor more information, see Transaction based filters .\n\nCampaigns & Coupons\n\nLets you build an audience group based on the count of redeemed coupons, about to expire coupons, and the number of messages received, and more.\n\nFor more information, see the Campaigns & Coupons based filters coupons based filters.\n\nUser Profile\n\nLets you build an audience group based on their demographic details, custom field details, subscription status, NDNC status, available communication channels, and more.\n\n*For more information, see User Profile based filters\n\nPurchase pattern\n\nLets you build an audience group based on their purchase behavior such as preferred shopping time, average transaction value, average basket value, top n customers, favorite products, and more.\n\nFor more information, see Purchase Pattern\n\nZero power filters\n\nLets you build an audience group with a specific prediction. When you combine zero-powered filters with standard filters, the chances are high to achieve a better hit rate, better incremental sales by offering relevant products to customers at the right time.\n\nBehavioural event\n\nLets you build an audience based on the behavioural vent of customers. For example, if you want to target users who has reviewed a product, you can filter the audience by adding the related  behavioural event filter (eg: User review event)\n\nTo add more customers, click Add more customers .\n\nOnce you finish configuring the required conditions, click Save Group to save the group.\n\nNotes\n\nA filtered audience list gets refreshed everyday, during EI sync. You can enable \"Execute message only after audience sync completion\" in the campaign message delivery setting and ensure that the campaign proceeds only after confirming the EI sync completion and verifying the audience refresh's up-to-date status. For more information, refer to the documentation on the same .\n\nBy default, the system tries to sync the required data about two hours before the campaign run time. If the sync is delayed or fails, data from two days ago may be used instead, and a banner appears in Insights indicating that syncing is still in progress.\n\nCreate audience group using csv file\n\nIf you have the customer list with you offline that you want to use to send campaigns, you can do it by creating and uploading the CSV file. Ensure that you upload the right identifiers according the target channel. For example, if you want to send SMS campaign, you need to have the CSV file with mobile numbers, for email campaign it should be email IDs and so on.\n\nNote\n\nWhile uploading audience lists, if dual eligibility is enabled for your organization, avoid using email addresses or mobile numbers, as these identifiers may not be unique. This is because multiple customers can share the same email or mobile number, which means the audience list may not work as expected.\n\nTo ensure accurate audience creation, use unique identifiers such as customer_external_id or user_id .\n\nTo create a new Audience Group, refer to the following:\n\nOn Dashboard, click the Audience tab.\n\nCreate New.\n\nEnter an Audience Group name .\n\nClick Upload a file , and then click Next .\n\nRefer to the following CSV upload instructions and upload a CSV file.\n\nDownload a sample CSV file.\n\nRemove the headers from the CSV file.\n\nThe file size can be up to 20 MB.\n\nAll the duplicate entries will be merged\n\nSelect an appropriate tag for each column, and then click Confirm and Upload.\n\nPreview the reachability of the audience in the group, and then click Done .\n\nNotes\n\nWhile uploading a CSV, an identifier tag is compulsory to include. Mobile, email, external id, and user id. The tags should be present in continuation. You can add a maximum of 5 custom tags.\n\nAfter clicking Confirm and upload, if the upload is taking a longer time, you may close it. The upload process will still continue in the background.\n\nIf an audience group is created using an uploaded CSV, the list will be static and not get refreshed.\n\nCreate audience group by combining existing lists\n\nYou can create an audience group by merging two audience groups. However, this is available only while creating a message.\n\nTo merge two audience groups in the message creation flow, refer to the following:\n\nOn the create a message flow, enter the new message details and then go to the Audience section.\n\nClick on the Add audience group .\n\nSelect the audience groups by selecting the checkbox next to it, and then click Done .\n\nEdit the combined audience list name by clicking on the edit icon.\n\nYou can add more audience groups by clicking on +Add audience groups .\n\nYou can remove an audience group by clicking on the cross icon \"X\" next to it.\n\nExclude audience : You can also exclude audiences from the combined list. To exclude an audience group from the selected audience, enable the Exclude audiences option using the toggle button. Click +Add audience group and create or select an audience group. The selected audience will be excluded from the campaign.\n\nThe combined list will appear on the audience page with the title 'combined list' below the audience group name.\n\nNote\n\nCombined audience lists remain static\n\nWhen you create an audience filter by combining two existing groups, the resulting dataset remains static. This means that any changes made to the two parent groups afterwards will not be reflected in this new dataset.\n\nFor instance, let's consider audience lists A and B. A includes elements 1, 2, and 3, while B includes elements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. If you create a new audience list C by selecting common elements from A and B, C will contain 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, even if you later update A to include elements 1, 2, 3, and 5, the changes will not impact C. C will continue to include only elements 1 and 2.\n\nCreate audience group using import via FTP connector option\n\nThis option enables you to create the audience list using the imported audience file available on the FTP server, thus allowing you to fetch customer lists from an external source daily. This external source could be other than the Capillary database. By default, the system tries to sync the required data about two hours before the campaign run time. If the sync is delayed or fails, data from two days ago may be used instead, and a banner appears in Insights indicating that syncing is still in progress.\n\nThis avoids the need to use the Segments capability on Insights+ to create audience groups containing customers from a source other than the Capillary database, such as a client FTP or a third-party FTP.\n\nNote\n\nThis feature is not available for all the orgs. Contact your CSR or create a JIRA ticket to sustenance team  to enable this feature.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nFile from the Databricks must be available in the FTP.\n\nAudience Reload from FTP template in Connect+ must be configured.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you are changing the audience group name, make sure that you change the same in the linked Connect+ dataflow. Otherwise, the Connect+ dataflow gets detached and the list will not be refreshed.\n\nProcedure\n\nTo import the audience using FTP, perform the following:\n\nNavigate to the Audience manager page and click Create new .\n\nEnter the Audience group name .\n\nNote\n\nDo not include spaces when entering the audience name. Adding spaces may result in an error.\n\nSelect Import via FTP connector and click Next .\n\nFrom the Unique identifier drop-down, select the unique identifier. This should be the unique identifier available in the Databricks file.\n\nFrom the Unique identifier drop-down, select the unique identifier. This should be the unique identifier available in the Databricks file.\n\nIn the Map fields section, map the fields to the FTP file.  For example, if column 1 in the file contains a user ID, select USER_ID from the drop-down and map it against column 1. You must define the mapping for at least one column and you can map up to a maximum of 3 columns.\n\nIn the Map fields section, map the fields to the FTP file.  For example, if column 1 in the file contains a user ID, select USER_ID from the drop-down and map it against column 1.

It shows whether your messages are encouraging customers to take desired actions such as making a purchase. This helps you understand the effectiveness of a campaign.\nThis feature tracks the number of customers who took action because of your campaign. You can define a conversion goal for each campaign. Once set, it monitors how many customers completed that goal after receiving your campaign message. This allows you to measure the true impact of your campaign on customer behavior.\n\nWhat is a Conversion Goal?\n\nA Conversion Goal helps measure the effectiveness of a campaign by tracking the number of customers who complete desired actions, such as making a qualifying purchase, after receiving a campaign message. By setting up conversion goals, you can gain insights into campaign performance, allowing you to improve messaging and targeting for better future outcomes. You can create custom conversion goals and measure campaign success based on real customer behaviour.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe feature includes several key capabilities:\n\nOrg-Level Default Conversion Goal Setting : Allows users to set a default conversion goal for all campaigns in the organization to keep tracking consistent. Users with access, should have the ability to view, edit, or remove this default goal.\n\nCampaign-Level Conversion Goal Setting : Allows users to customize conversion goals for individual campaigns . This can be done if there's no org-level default Conversion Goal is set up. Campaign-level goals are specific to that campaign and do not affect org-level settings or other campaigns.\n\nTracking and Reporting : Provides capabilities to analyze campaign performance through detailed metrics and reports.\n\nNotes\n\nThis feature needs to be enabled for your organization by creating a JIRA ticket to the Capillary Product Support team.\n\nYou can edit the conversion goal at any time before the first message in the campaign is approved. Once the first message is approved, the option to edit the conversion goal will no longer be available.\n\nConfiguring a Conversion Goal\n\nWhen configuring a conversion goal, you define several parameters:\n\nConversion Events : The events you want to track to measure campaign success.\n\nNote\n\nThe supported customer events for the Conversion Goal currently focus on Transactional Events (customer makes a transaction).\n\nConditions : Based on the selected event, you can add conditions to decide which actions should be counted for campaign tracking.

This campaign type lets you automatically export and sync audience segments from Engage+ to your chosen advertising platform. The audience data is synced to the Ad platform using a third-party service provider.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, the Ads Audience campaign is not enabled. Create a JIRA ticket for the Capillary Product Support Team to enable this feature.\n\nKey Benefits\n\nAutomated workflow saves time and reduce errors by replacing manual list uploads with fully automated and scheduled audience syncs.\n\nPrecision targeting ensures your audiences are always accurate and updated.

Use a new segment name when your goal is to target a new or updated audience list.\n\nWhy: This creates a new audience group on the advertising platform, preventing overlap with users already targeted.\n\nExample: On Day 1, you create a segment named Inactive_Users_July_Week1 with Audience Group A.\n  On Day 5, create a new segment like Inactive_Users_July_Week2 with Audience Group B that exclude\nusers already targeted in the first campaign.\n\nb. Reuse the same segment name when your goal is to retarget the same audience.\n\nWhy: This avoids duplication of audience groups on the advertising platform or third-party service provider. Reusing the same name ensures the platform updates the existing audience group instead of creating a new one.\n\nExample: On Day 1, you create a campaign with segment name Abandoned_Cart_Users using Audience Group A.\n  On Day 5, to retarget the same users, create a new campaign with Audience Group A and reuse the same\nsegment name Abandoned_Cart_Users .\n\nIf you use a different segment name with the same audience group, a new audience group will be created on the advertising platform, leading to duplication.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago"}

The selected scope is applied to the audience and content of the message.\n\nNote\n\nThis option is available only for MLP-enabled orgs.\n\nMLP Scope in Campaign\n\nMany organizations either conglomerates or single entities might require to configure multiple loyalty programs.\n\nLarge conglomerates may require to set up different loyalty programs for their sub-organizations. For example :\nA conglomerate that operates in different verticals such as hotels, airlines, retail, etc. under different brand names. All these brands have their own loyalty program. Again, a customer can be part of more than one Loyalty Program.\n\nAn organization may partner with various other companies and have different partner-loyalty programs with different partners. For example :\nA petroleum company has partnered with many companies. It has rolled out partner-loyalty programs with 130+ partners. It gives partner-co-branded loyalty cards to its customers. Customers use these cards during purchases and avail of points/discounts and other benefits. Again, a customer can be part of more than one partner-loyalty program.\n\nEither way, a customer from the same organization becomes part of multiple loyalty programs. To ensure personalized communication to customers, it becomes important to uniquely segment customers in the context of a particular loyalty program and then interact with them. This will help the brands to drive KPIs such as cross-vertical sales, and boost average transaction value, and transaction frequency.\n\nIn addition to the filter to segment customers based on their subscription to a specific loyalty program, the following filters are also added to the scope of the loyalty program.\n\nLoyalty program registration date\n\nActive points\n\nRedeemed points\n\nNumber of transactions\n\nFor Example : If marketers were to identify customers who have more than 5000 active points from the loyalty program, then the active points filter should consider how many active points the customer has with this Loyalty program and not the total active points she has from all loyalty programs combined. This is achieved when\n\nthe scope/information about the loyalty program is passed to each filter\n\nfilters honor the scope and accordingly filter users.\n\nFeature updates\n\nThe following changes are added in Engage+.\n\nIn Campaign, Message users can now select a Loyalty Program. This selected program/ scope will be passed to Filters.\n\nNotes\n\nIf a loyalty program is chosen, then the audience through filters contains customers of that Loyalty Program.\n\nAny other filter chosen will work in accordance with the scope.\n\nIn the Campaign Message, users can select a Loyalty Program. This selected program/ scope will be passed to Labels.\n\nNotes\n\nIf in creatives, any labels such as total_points, points_expiry_date are chosen, then the values of the loyalty program passed in scope.\n\nUse case\n\nCustomer Understanding : One customer can be part of multiple loyalty programs. A marketing manager would want to reach out to customers belonging to a certain loyalty program and send promotional messages with tags such as current points, card number, expiry date, coupons, and promotional points. In a single promotional message, the marketing manager would not like to talk about different loyalty programs (as these could be entirely different organizations or partners).\nWith the new development, the scope gets restricted to the loyalty program chosen, so the audience targeted remains specific to the selected loyalty program and the labels resolve to values with respect to the selected loyalty program. Hence, the error of sending messages to non-intended audiences and the error of showing wrong points, card numbers, expiry dates, etc. in the content reduces significantly.\n\nLoyalty program-specific use case : A brand can have programs for different partners or sub-organizations. With each partner or sub-organization, they might want to focus on different strategies or objectives such as boosting sales, getting feedback, and running offers. For example:\n\nIncrease transaction frequency: For Partner 1, if the brand wants to increase transaction frequency, using the Scope filter, the marketing manager will be able to first identify the audience for Partner 1 and then use transaction filters to identify customers with a low visit count for Partner 1 (only). Then the identified customers can be given relevant offers to promote visits to the store and transact with Partner 1.\n\nIncrease sales: Loyalty sales for sub-organization A/ Partner A is low. The marketing manager can identify the audience only for that loyalty program and run campaigns for increasing visits, ATV, ATB, etc. Communication/ offers can be personalized by segmenting customers. Filters such Recency < 3 months, ATV > $500, active point = 1000, transaction frequency = 7 times/ year etc. can be applied.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nOrg needs to have Multiple Loyalty Programs.\n\nBrand or Capillary POC can raise a ticket with the sustenance team requesting to enable the <> campaigns.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded Scope selection in the message creation flow to target customers belonging to a specific loyalty program.\n\nNote\n\nThis scope will remain valid throughout the Campaign Message and thus will get applied to Filters and Labels.\n\nTo use this feature, follow these steps.\n\nThe Loyalty program can be selected from the dropdown menu. Search functionality is also provided for ease of use.\n\nSince there can be multiple Card Series/ OUs belonging to the same Loyalty program, the selection needs to be done at the Card Series or OU level.\n\nUsage example:\n\nFor orgs, one loyalty program may encompass multiple card series. Hence, the scope can be selected at the Card Series level. Marketers can select Loyalty Program > Card Series.\n\nFor Petron Org, however, there is a 1-1 mapping between loyalty program and card series hence the scope can be selected at Card series structure.\n\nFor orgs such as Tata, one loyalty program like the Tata Group Loyalty Program may encompass loyalty programs for different OUs such as Titan, Tanishq, etc. Hence the scope can be selected at the OU level and hence marketers can select Loyalty Program > OU.\n\nNotes\n\nOnce the scope is selected it will remain the same throughout the Campaign Message and cannot be changed.\n\nNone needs to be selected in case the Loyalty Program scope is not needed.\n\nFilters in Audience Manager will honor the selected scope: If any message scope is 'None’ then in Audience Group the selected Loyalty Program is passed as scope. The Filtered Customers List will have customers who belong to the selected Loyalty Program.\n\nCreating Audience by applying Filter:\n\nTransaction and Loyalty Filters can now understand scope definition -\n\nTransaction filter example : If Loyalty Program/Card Series A is selected and we give the condition “Include customers whose transaction count is 0-5 during specific date range\", then only customers of the card series A who have done less than 5 transactions appear in the list. Since one customer can belong to more than one Loyalty Program, 5 transactions might have been done with a combination of Card Series A/B/C. Without passing scope the identification of the right customer is not possible.\n\nLoyalty filter example : If Loyalty Program/Card Series A is selected and we give the condition “Include customers whose active points are in the range of 0-500 then customers who have less than 500 active points with Card Series A will only appear in the list. Since one customer can belong to more than one Loyalty Program, less than 500 points might have been with a combination of Card Series A+B+C. Without passing scope the identification of the right customer is not possible.\n\nLimitation: There is no way for Engage+ backend to understand if the Audience List (filtered/ uploaded) contains an Audience belonging to a single Loyalty Program/ Card Series type. If the scope of the Campaign is Loyalty Program A / Card Series A and the audience list contains customers from card series A and B then people from series B will not be reached out/ skipped.\n\nHence, it is advisable to create an Audience list with the correct scope or upload a list with only one type of Loyalty program customer and then use the same in the Campaign.\n\nLabel resolution for content will be as per the selected scope : If for any message scope is ‘not-None’ then for Label resolution the selected Loyalty Program is passed as scope. The Loyalty and card-related Labels/ tags will get resolved for the respective Program only.\n\nFor example: If the selected Loyalty program is A and the tag used in creatives is {{total_points_to_expire_day(7)}} then the Card Series A points will be mentioned in the message.\n\nNew Labels for Card Series (Card Number, Card Issue Date, Card Series Name) have also been added. Usage Nuance:\nFor a petroleum company, one customer can have more than one card from the same Card series/ Loyalty Program. In case of any conflict on tag resolution, the card which was more recently used in a transaction or recently registered will be used.\n\nFuture scope\n\nMultiple Loyalty Programs selection in the scope:\n\nMarketers will be able to select more than one Loyalty Program as a scope. If Loyalty Program A and B are selected together then customers only in Loyalty Program A, only in Loyalty Program B, and both in Loyalty Program A & B will be part of the campaign. The tag resolution will also happen for both of the Loyalty Programs.\n\nTo enable message personalization, enable the Optimization Strategy toggle button\n\nPersonalization : Select this option to allow personalize your message based on the product, region, and time. A single message can have different content for different audiences based on all the above categories.\n\nChannel priority : This option allows reaching customers through different channels based on their availability without the need for creating multiple messages or campaigns. This helps in effectively minimizing the cost of communication and maximizing the probability of conversion by prioritizing channels that can give higher ROI. For example, you can contact the audience on WeChat and SMS. If customers are not reachable on SMS, contact through email, and so on.\n\nX-Engage : X-Engage campaigns enable Orgs to engage with their customers through multiple channels, including all direct channels like SMS, Email, Mobile Push; and ads. channels like Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Youtube. For details, see X-Engage.\n\nAdd audience\n\nThe Audience is the recipient of your campaign message.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/cart-promotion-overview", "title": "Overview", "text": "Overview\n\nCart Promotion also called as promotion or promo engine is a type of promotion or discount that helps brands create promotions focused on products in the shopping cart of the customer. Unlike traditional Point-of-Sale (PoS) promotions, which are mainly designed to boost sales, these promotions are event-driven, rule-based, and offer instant gratification during product search or checkout. They are applied on a running campaign to engage customers and build relationships, not just drive transactions.\n\nBenefits of cart promotions\n\nFeature\n\nBrand\n\nCustomer\n\nPersonalized Promotions\n\n• Targeted promotions\n• Discount optimization\n• Flexible program setup\n• Diverse benefits\n\n•Personalized experience\n•Instant gratification\n• Relevant offers & more visibility\n\nConvenient setup & ease of usage\n\n• Manage all from one place\n• Create & optimize on the\n• Advanced budgeting control\n\n• No OTP or coupon code\n• Faster checkout\n\nVisibility & Control\n\n• Real-time monitoring\n• Measure and optimize spends\n\n• Activate/deactivate\n• Earn or exchange points for reward\n\nNote\n\nBy default, Cart Promotion is not enabled for all the orgs. Raise a ticket to the Product Support team to enable.\n\nKey features:\n\nEnsures that customers get the most relevant cart discount running at the time.\n\nDiscounts are tailored and based on customer interactions, product preferences and shopping activities.\n\nPromotions are automatically applied at checkout and customers don't need to search for coupons available.\n\nRelevant and customized discounts motivate customers to finish their purchase.\n\nThe promotion strategy is optimized to enhance conversion rate and engagement.\n\nAllows organization to upsell and cross sell by offering targeted discounts.\n\nHelps to configure strategies based on customer, product, store, location, and customer activities.\n\nConfiguring cart promotion redemption strategy\n\nThe promotion redemption process supports two strategies for applying discounts to a transaction:\n\nThe standard approach involves the promotion engine evaluating a cart and returning a final, calculated set of discounts to be applied.\n\nAn alternative strategy offers greater flexibility by separating the evaluation and redemption steps. This flow allows an external system to first request a complete list of all available promotions for the items in a cart. The external system can then apply its own logic to determine the final combination of discounts, and after the transaction is complete, it informs the promotion engine which specific promotions were redeemed.\n\nTo use the default strategy, set the cart promotion redemption strategy  to REDEMPTION_AGAINST_CART_EVALUATION .\nTo use the alternate strategy, set the cart promotion redemption strategy to REDEMPTION_WITHOUT_CART_EVALUATION .\n\nTo configure the cart promotion redemption strategy for your organisation, raise a JIRA ticket to the Capillary Product Support team.\n\nUpdated 14 days ago"}

They are commonly used in influencer marketing and promotional campaigns.\n\nPromo codes can be issued via partners, physical coupons, or email campaigns.\n\nCustomers use these codes at checkout for various discounts, such as fixed amounts, percentage-based reductions, free products, or bundled pricing.\n\nCodes are valid both in-store and online, depending on the brand’s distribution method.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nEach promo code can be used only once per customer.\n\nCodes expire when the promotion ends.\n\nBrands can set limits on how many times a code can be redeemed.\n\nExample Influencer Marketing:\n\nA brand provides an influencer named Mansi with the promo code HOLIMAN100.\n\nShe shares it with her followers, but the brand limits redemptions to the first 1,000 users.\n\nUpdated 3 months ago"}

With \"Line-item with cart\" evaluation, promotions apply in order: (1) 10% off shoes = $90, (2) Buy 1 towel get 1 free = $10, creating a new subtotal of $100. Then (3) 10% off cart for purchases above $99 applies to this $100 subtotal, demonstrating how cart-level promotions calculate on the reduced amount after line-item promotions are processed first.\n\nCart or lineitem with cart first\n\nCart-level promotions are applied first.

At the same time if another cashier applies the same promotion to another cart before the system registers the first redemption, the capillary system proceeds ahead as it cannot reject any redemption. As a result customer may receive benefits beyond the allowed number of redemptions.\n\nCart Promotion Transaction Flow of Events:\n\nCustomer makes a purchase and proceeds to checkout.\n\nCashier adds items to the cart and checks for applicable promotions.\n\nCart promotions returns the applicable offers (At this point promotions are not redeemed but merely evaluated for the cart and is indicative of the benefits)\n\nCashier applies the offers and proceeds for payment (Customer has received the benefit hence Capillary cannot reject any redemption)\n\nCapillary system receives the transaction (via transactionAdd API).\n\nThe transactionAdd API internally calls the cart promotions module to redeem the promotions and update the redemption KPIs . Two things can happen here: Redemption identifier is valid and irrespective of the breach in KPI we record the redemption. Redemption identifier is invalid. Currently these are rejected by the cart promotions module.\n\nRedemption identifier is valid and irrespective of the breach in KPI we record the redemption.\n\nRedemption identifier is invalid. Currently these are rejected by the cart promotions module.\n\nWith step 4 & 6 being not simultaneous, it leads to a potential loophole where the promotion benefit has been given to the customer but the corresponding redemption has not happened in the cart promotions.\n\nHow Cart Locking Prevents This Issue\n\nTo prevent such loopholes, a cart locking feature is triggered internally whenever a promotion is applied.\n\nNote\n\nIt is not explicitly enabled. The feature is triggered directly when a promotion is applied.\n\nFor every cart identifier, the system calculates promotion redemption KPIs at both customer and promotion level. These computations are transient or temporary in nature and block the usage of the promotion(s) for new cart identifiers. Evaluate payload must include unique cart identifier given by cart promotions.\n\nIf the POS makes a second evaluate or getOffers call during an ongoing transaction, it must use the same cart identifier.\n\nFor the same cart identifier, if a new request is received for the same customer the temporary values will be reversed and cart to be evaluated as new.\n\nOnce the transaction is completed, the temporary values become permanent.\n\nIn case the transaction is cancelled or timeout, the temporary state can be released by the below methods. External - API call with the same cart identifier. Time based trigger -Brand can set up a default time to release the lock in case the external trigger is not received\n\nExternal - API call with the same cart identifier.\n\nTime based trigger -Brand can set up a default time to release the lock in case the external trigger is not received\n\nHow it happens:\n\nYou are running cart promotions and you want to make sure that once a promotion is applied, it doesn’t create any conflicts or allow customers to unfairly use it multiple times before it's officially recorded. Here’s how the process works:\n\nOnce the Cashier starts the transaction, by scanning the items, he sends a getOffers request to the system to check for the available offers running.\n\nThe system temporarily locks the promotion and updates the KPI (to track how many times are the offers being used by the customer).\n\nIf the customer tries to remove and reapply the offer, system prevents the action by blocking it: For discount: It fails at promotionId level. For vouchers: It fails at earnId level.\n\nFor discount: It fails at promotionId level.\n\nFor vouchers: It fails at earnId level.\n\nWhen the customer checks for promotions on app or store, the system instantly updates and shows the offers that are active and locked.\n\nIf the final transaction confirmation is delayed, customer will see the offers in locked state, which means that they cannot apply or use their offers again until the transaction is completed or system unlocks it.\n\nCustomers options are: Wait for transaction to complete. Contact Customer Support Wait for system to auto unlock the offer after 24 hours.\n\nWait for transaction to complete.\n\nContact Customer Support\n\nWait for system to auto unlock the offer after 24 hours.\n\nUpdated 3 months ago"}

These conditions are based on the actions a customer performs. Once the customer successfully performs an action, they progress within the journey.\n\nThis is applicable for the event based wait block\n\nCustomer events\n\nCustomer events are specific actions or activities performed by a customer that are tracked and used as triggers within journeys. This helps initiate or influence the progression of a customer through different stages of a journey based on their real-time interactions and behaviours.\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are logical rules or criteria used to evaluate customer data and behaviours at various points in a journey. Their primary purpose is to segment and direct customers through different paths based on specific attributes or actions, such as purchase history, loyalty status, or engagement patterns.\n\nWait Criteria\n\nWait criteria defines the time period since the customer has performed an action such as registering or making a transaction.\n\nEngagement event conditions\n\nEngagement event conditions are criteria within journeys that determine how a customer progresses through a journey based on their interactions with previous communications.

Configure entry trigger\n\nAn entry trigger defines which customers will enter the journey.\n\nAn entry trigger is used to differentiate between customers and move them onto different entry paths based on their behavior to enhance their engagement with the brand. A user enters the journey only after the entry condition is satisfied by them.\n\nKey features:\n\nEnables brands to segregate their customers based on their transactional and behavioral patterns\n\nEnables brands to create hyper-personalized journeys for their customers which in turn results in higher customer retention.\n\nCustomer behavior can be either transactional or behavioral, and brands can configure their exact requirements within the entry trigger.\n\nUser events trigger\n\nIn a User event trigger which is also called a user-initiated trigger, the customer enters the journey based on any transactional or non-transactional activity (behavioural events). With the help of user events, brands can include multiple paths within a journey depending on customer activity.\n\nTransactional events are standard whereas behavioral events are configurable by individual brands to suit their requirements. While adding transactional triggers, the brand has to choose between the following events:\n\nTransactional events\n\nBehavioral events\n\nThese events include both standard as well as customized events.

The date can be added to the calendar that is displayed once this option is selected.\n\n4) (Optional) Configure exit trigger\n\nAn exit trigger is to remove a customer from a journey if they satisfy a given condition. Brands can configure transactional and behavioural events that can cause a customer to exit a journey. This ensures that customers do not get spam/out-of-context engagements.\nThis leads to a higher click rate on engagements and in turn leads to successful conversions.\n\nUse Cases\n\nA brand wants to target customers who have purchased shoes from them and want to motivate them to buy clothes as well. If a customer has already purchased from the clothes category, they should not receive promotional messages to buy clothes which can be configured in the exit trigger.\n\nBrands want to motivate users by asking them to upgrade to members. Customers who purchased the membership should be exited from the membership promotional journey\n\nAdding an exit trigger\n\nIn the journey canvas page, click Exit trigger .\n\nIn the Define: Exit trigger page, select how you want to make a user exit a journey. Here, two ways to exit a customer are supported Filtered audience exit User Event\n\nFiltered audience exit\n\nUser Event\n\nThe two types of exit triggers have different use cases, determining which to use depends on the situation.\n\nWhen to use a Filtered Audience exit\n\nUse Case: The brand has used the Audience list as an Entry trigger in Journeys.\nThe requirement is that anyone who does not satisfy the audience list at any point in time should get exited from the journey.\n\nHow to use a Filtered Audience Exit:\n\nTo enable this, Toggle the option Filtered Audience exit to “ON”. By default, it will be set as No.\n\nTo enable this, Toggle the option Filtered Audience exit to “ON”. By default, it will be set as No.\n\nIf this is enabled, customers will exit the journey if they no longer satisfy the audience-filtered criteria configured in the entry trigger. 📘 NOTE This can be used only when the entry criteria is set as Audience list.\n\nIf this is enabled, customers will exit the journey if they no longer satisfy the audience-filtered criteria configured in the entry trigger.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis can be used only when the entry criteria is set as Audience list.\n\nWhen to use a User Event-based exit\n\nUse Case: Brand has used a User-based event as an Entry trigger in Journeys.\nThe requirement is that when a particular customer does any event (standard event such as transaction/coupon redemption) or a behavioural event, they exit from a journey.\n\nHow to use a User Event Exit trigger:\n\nSelect the User Event Exit trigger and Click Next .\n\nFrom the Who have performed the event drop-down, select the event. You can select either transactional or behavioural events.\n\nDefine the conditions for the customer to exit the journey. This is similar to the defining conditions in the entry event.\nYou can define only one condition/path for the exit trigger.\n\nClick Done .\n\nTo edit the exit condition, hover over the block and click on the edit icon.\n\nHow to reset an exit trigger\n\nThis feature enables brands to reset their exit trigger within a journey. With this feature, a brand can remove an existing condition from its journey that allows customers to exit the journey.\n\nUse Cases\n\nA simple reset button not only allows brands to remove a pre-configured existing trigger but in case of multiple triggers, brands can remove all of them with the click of a button. It saves time and the hassle of removing each condition manually.\n\nResetting an exit trigger\n\nOnce the journey canvas is opened, navigate to the exit trigger.\n\nUpon hovering over the exit trigger, a reset icon will appear.\n\nClick on the reset icon to reset the entire configuration of the exit trigger.\n\n5) Configure journey settings\n\nYou can configure the below settings for the journey.\n\nEntry settings\n\nCustomer entry to the same journey\n\nThis feature allows you to enable the same journey for customers multiple times if they meet the entry conditions. It supports consistent engagement and helps reach customers at the right moment.\n\nThis helps to:\n\nMaintain consistency in engagement\n\nProvides a good customer experience by limiting over-communicating with the customers\n\nThe following conditions must be satisfied for a customer to enter or re-enter the journey. You can configure the settings as follows:\n\nFrequency of a customer entering the journey - Set how many times a customer is allowed to enter the journey.\n\nCustomer can be in this journey simultaneously - Allow a customer to be part of the journey more than once at the same time if the customer meet the entry conditions again.\n\nThese are the settings for how often a customer can enter the journey:\n\nExample Use Case\n\nScenario 1 - Ticket Confirmation Reminder\n\nA Ticket Confirmation Reminder journey allows customers to receive a confirmation email after booking a ticket, with the following settings and conditions:\n\nJourney Conditions\n\nBooking Requirement: The customer must successfully book a ticket (for an event, travel, or movie).\n\nNotification: They receive a confirmation email with their ticket details.\n\nWait Period: The confirmation email is sent 15 min after the ticket booking is completed.\n\nRestrictions\n\nEntry Limit: The customer can participate in the journey for one booking at a time.\n\nRe-entry Condition: After receiving the confirmation email for their current booking, the customer can re-enter the journey by booking another ticket.\n\nCustomer Journey Behavior\n\nOnce the customer books a ticket, they will receive a confirmation email after 15 minutes. If they book another ticket while waiting for the first confirmation, they must wait until the first email is sent before they can receive a new confirmation for the next booking.\n\nConfiguration Settings for the Scenario:\n\nScenario 2 - Electronics Store Cashback Offer\n\nA Festive Season Cashback Deal allows customers to earn $1000 cashback on a ₹10,000 electronics purchase, with the following settingd and conditions:\n\nJourney Conditions\n\nPurchase Requirement: The customer must buy electronic items worth ₹10,000 or more.\n\nReward: They receive ₹1000 cashback for each qualifying purchase.\n\nWait Period: Cashback will be credited 2 days after the purchase.\n\nOffer Validity: The offer is valid for 30 days from the campaign start date.\n\nRestrictions\n\nEntry Limit: The customer can participate more than once during the 30-day period.\n\nRe-entry Condition: The customer can receive cashback a maximum of 3 times during the 30-day period.\n\nCustomer Journey Behavior\n\nDuring the festive sale, customers can earn ₹1000 cashback every time they buy electronics worth ₹10,000 or more. They can avail this offer up to 3 times within 30 days. The cashback is processed 2 days after each qualifying purchase. Customers are allowed to make multiple purchases at the same time (as long as they haven’t hit the 3-time limit).\n\nConfiguration Settings for the scenario\n\nAllow global control customers to enter the journey\n\nYou can enable this to include the Control audience (a control audience is a group of individuals who are intentionally left out of a campaign, in order to serve as a group for comparison) in the journey. By default, the control audience is not included in the journey.\n\nCommunication Settings\n\nYou can enable the toggle switch Ignore subscription status for all communication channels to send messages including transactional messages to all customers, even if their promotional subscriptions are configured to not receive messages. This bypasses the promotional subscription status settings.\n\nLink Tracking Settings\n\nYou can enable the toggle switch to shorten URLs in communication messages.\n\nJourney alerts\n\nJourney Alerts are automated email notifications that keep you informed about important events related to journeys.

Journey Alerts are automated email notifications designed to keep you informed about critical events in your marketing journeys. They enable you to proactively monitor campaigns for approval requests, execution failures, or upcoming end dates, allowing you to take timely action and ensure your campaigns run smoothly.\n\n2. I'm trying to add a team member to the notification list, but I'm unable to find them. Why? The person selection dropdown list shows only people who are configured as a point of contact (POC) for your organization. If you can't find a team member, an administrator must first add them to the organization POC list.\n\n3. If I set the expiry alert to seven days in advance, will I get a notification every day for those seven days? No. The alert is sent only once. You will receive a single notification exactly seven days before the journey is scheduled to expire, providing you with a one-time notification.\n\n4. Can I apply these alert settings to a specific journey only? No, the current alert settings are global. When you configure a person to get an alert (for example, a status change alert), they will get that alert for all journeys created on the platform. Journey-specific alert settings aren't currently available.\n\n5. How are the alerts delivered? All Journey Alerts are delivered by email to the people you select in the configuration.\n\n6. Is there an alert for when an A/B test is complete? An alert for A/B test status isn't available in the current version of the feature.\n\n6. Send Journey for Approval\n\nBefore sending a journey for approval, ensure the following:\n\nNew Credit management system is enabled for your org. If it is not, kindly raise a ticket to the Sustenance team.\n\nCredit rates for all channels that are used for communication in the journey are configured.\n\nAfter you have configured steps 1 to 5 above, you need to save the journey and send it for approval by clicking on \"Send for approval\".\n\nOnce the journey has been sent for approval, the approver can approve the journey and the journey will go live as per the schedule configured in Step 3 above.\n\nApprover can also reject the journey if the journey needs certain modifications. In that case, journey will go to \"Rejected\" state and you will have to make changes to the journey by clicking \"Edit\"\n\nUpdated about 2 hours ago"}

After the entry trigger, the building blocks define the journey of a customer.  Each building block has a  specific purpose in the journey.\n\nThe building blocks available to create a journey is classified into 3 sections:\n\nEngagements\n\nFlow control\n\nActions\n\nAdding a building block to the journey canvas\n\nTo add any building block to the canvas, drag and drop the desired block to the journey canvas.\n\nA/B testing block\n\nA/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method in customer Journeys that helps to compare different content and engagement methods for specific segments of customers over a defined period. This allows you to gather valuable insights about which configurations perform better with the audience. Based on the results obtained, you can make informed decisions about which configuration to adopt for the remainder of the customer journey.\n\nFor information on configuring the A/B testing block, refer to the detailed documentation on the A/B testing block .\n\nNote\n\nThe A/B testing block is a replacement for the engagement block. If you are running an A/B test, you don’t need to include another engagement block.\n\nEngagement building block\n\nThe engagement block contains different types of channels that can be used to engage with your customers. A marketer can add an engagement block (of a particular channel) and configure the content in that block (specific to that channel) to reach out to users.\n\nThe various engagement blocks available are:\n\nSMS\n\nEmail\n\nM-push\n\nWhatsApp\n\nZalo\n\nLine\n\nViber\n\nUse Case\n\nA brand wants to include customers whose transactional value is greater than $10,000 in the Journey and communicate the discounts that can be availed by these customers via SMS.\n\nAdding engagement block\n\nTo add an engagement block,\n\nClick on the engagement block.\n\nIn the Engagement name text box, enter a name for the engagement block.\n\nClick Add creative .\n\nSelect an existing template or create a new template. For information on creating templates, see SMS Template , Email Template , M-Push Template , WhatsApp template , ZALO template , Line template , and Viber template . You can use the Channel Priority block to send the communication message based on the availability of the customer's communication channel. For more information, refer to the documentation on Channel Priority in Journey .\n\nAdd the information as required.\n\nClick Done .\n\nTo add incentives along with the engagement message, click +Add incentives and add desired incentives. Currently offers, points, cart promotions, gift vouchers and badges are the Incentives supported in Journeys. For more information on how to add incentives, see Add incentives .\n\nTo remove or change incentives, click the three dots adjacent to the offers/points and click Remove/Change <Incentive name> .\n\nTo preview or remove the template added, click the three dots inside the template and click Preview/Remove.\n\nIn the Delivery settings , enter the delivery settings details. See Delivery settings .\n\nIncentives in engagement message\n\nYou can add incentives such as offer, points and cart promotion details along with the engagement messages. To add, perform the following:\n\nClick on the engagement block.\n\nClick Add incentives .\n\nSelect the desired option.\n\nClick Select/Done/Claim .\n\nClick Done .\n\nThe selected incentive is added to the engagement message. For information on creating any type of incentive, see Incentive management .\n\nFlow control building block\n\nFlow control helps you control the flow of the journey by applying conditions to user events or user preferences.\n\nMarketers can define different conditions in a customer journey to guide users through different flows based on specific criteria such as time or event-based preferences. These conditions serve as additional decision points that determine whether the user will continue on the same path or be directed to a different flow.\n\nThe various flow control blocks available are:\n\nTime-based wait\n\nEvent-based wait\n\nJoin\n\nDecision split\n\nTime-based wait\n\nThe time-based wait is used by brands to engage customers at a particular time/date or after a specified period. This is preferred after analyzing user behaviour and targeting users at a crucial time to improve engagement.\n\nThis feature allows brands to target their customers at the right time to increase engagement and can avoid spamming the customer. This can increase click-through rates and would motivate the target customer to perform a desired behaviour.\n\nUse Cases\n\nA brand has analyzed that their customers have high activity rates mostly on the weekends and they want to send out communication messages during that period.\n\nCertain countries have rules that engagements with customers should go out on particular days of the week/date of the month and rates for some days of the week are lower than the other. This would allow brands to comply with government rules and also save engagement costs\n\nConfiguring time-based wait\n\nDrag and drop the Wait block on the journey canvas.\n\nOn the journey canvas, click Time based wait .\n\nIn the Block name , enter a name for the wait block.\n\nDefine the wait duration.

It will continue from the remaining duration.\n\nEvent-based wait\n\nThis feature allows brands to configure user journeys based on the behaviour of the customer. Brands can configure separate paths for customers based on an event-based wait time. The wait can be configured in two ways - wait since event and wait till event.\n\nThis allows brands to personalize journeys for users who perform a desired action and for new users that are yet to act. This also reduces the redundancy of messages and eliminates sending irrelevant messages to users.\n\nUse Cases\n\nThe brand wants to give the customers a 10% off coupon if they make a purchase of 5000 within 30 days and if they do not make a purchase, the brand wants to share an upcoming offer message.\n\nThe brand wants to give customers a 10% off coupon after they have completed 90 days since the last purchase date.\n\nConfiguring event-based wait block\n\nTo configure the event-based wait block, follow these steps\n\nDrag and drop the Event based wait to the Journey canvas.\n\nSelect the Event based wait block on the canvas to open the configuration menu.\n\nIn the Block name text box, enter a name for the block.\n\nSelect the wait conditions from the Wait Type drop-down.

It reduces the time and effort of the brand to configure similar paths within a single journey. This feature saves the time of the marketer by disabling the hassle of creating multiple journeys/paths to send customers on a common path. It also maintains continuity and familiarity of engagements sent to customers\n\nUse Cases\n\nBrands want to nudge their customers to purchase their seasonal collections.

The configured incentives will be displayed when previewing the Journey.\n\nWebhook\n\nThe webhook block allows your Journeys to communicate and send real-time information to external, third-party systems. This allows you to automate tasks in external systems like your CRM, support desk, or advertising platforms. When a customer reaches this point in a journey, it automatically sends data to a webhook URL you specify.\n\nFor example, when a customer gives a low satisfaction score in a survey, a Journey can automatically start. A Webhook block within that journey can instantly connect to your support system, like Zendesk, and create a ticket. The webhook sends the customer's details and their poor feedback directly into the ticket, alerting your support team to resolve the issue immediately.\n\nTo configure the webhook block, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Block Name box, enter a name for the webhook block.\n\nFrom the Method list, choose the request type.

This allows you to gather valuable insights about which configurations perform better with the audience. Based on the results obtained, you can make informed decisions about which configuration to adopt for the remainder of the customer journey.\n\nExample\n\nConsider a scenario where a brand wants to run a holiday e-mail marketing campaign journey for 20 days. With A/B testing you can trigger the campaign with two different subject lines: \"Save Big Today!\" and \"Limited-Time Offer Inside!\".\nHere, the independent variable would be the subject line variation, while the dependent variable would be the click-through rate – how many recipients open the email and click on the links inside.\nBy conducting A/B testing for the initial few days, you can compare the performance of these two subject lines and determine which one leads to a higher click-through rate. Once you've analyzed the results and identified the most effective subject line, you can use that version for the remaining duration of the holiday email campaign journey, maximizing engagement with your target audience.\n\nConfiguring A/B testing for a journey\n\nTo configure the A/B testing for a journey, perform the following while configuring a journey:\n\nDrag and drop the A/B testing block on the journey canvas.\n\nNote\n\nThe A/B testing block is a replacement for the engagement block. If you are running an A/B test, you don’t need to include another engagement block.\n\nIn the Block name , enter a name for the A/B testing.\n\nFrom the Variants and audience split section , select the Engagement channel and Incentives (optional).\n\nIn the Variants , add Creatives and Incentives (if applicable) for the variants. To add an additional variant, click Add more variant . A maximum of three variants are supported.\n\nClick Edit audience split and define the audience proportion for the variants, the split of what %age of your test customers should get which variant. By default, audiences for the variants are split equally.\n\nNotes\n\nSum of audience split percentages for each variant should equal 100%.\n\nAudience split for any variant cannot be zero.\n\nFractional values are not allowed.\n\nIn the Deliver settings , configure the delivery settings.\n\nIn the Length of the test section, define the following: Number of customers (mandatory): The minimum number of customers that should enter the journey. You can define this number based on your knowledge and should be realistic based on the journey configured and your organization’s customer base. For example, if your organisation’s customer base is 10,000 do not set the test criteria to be more than 1000-2000. The ideal number of test customers is 20-30% of your expected audience count who will enter the journey. The number of entrants should be equal to or greater than the number of variants. The number of entrants should not exceed the total number of customers in the organization.\nii. Duration (Optional) : After defining the number of entrants, you can choose to conclude the test immediately or select an additional number of days for the test to run after reaching the minimum number of entrants. The system then automatically selects the next set of defined number of entrants for the additional days.\n\nNumber of customers (mandatory): The minimum number of customers that should enter the journey.

The system then automatically selects the next set of defined number of entrants for the additional days.\n\nNote:\n\nA minimum of one-day wait duration is applicable to all A/B tests after the number of test users criteria is met. For example, if the A/B testing gets completed in a couple of hours, the system still takes a minimum of one day to decide the winning variant.\n\nFrom the Test- criteria dropdown, select the KPIs to calculate the winning variant of your test. The system displays the KPIs based on the engagement selected. Engagement Level KPIs : The engagement level KPIs are available by default. The Engagement Level KPIs listed in the dropdown depend on the selected channel. For instance, in Email, you will have access to metrics such as open rate and delivery rate, whereas in SMS, only the delivery rate will be available. Incentive Level KPIs : These are available only if you have added Incentives for the test.\nYou can select a Maximum of 5 KPIs in total across both categories.\n\nFrom the Test- criteria dropdown, select the KPIs to calculate the winning variant of your test.

When you make the edited journey live, your test will start from the beginning, starting again from entrant number 1.\n\nA/B testing scenario when pausing a journey:\n\nIf you pause a journey where an A/B test is live, the test will also be paused. The test will resume when you resume the journey and the test will be completed when the test criteria (number of entrants) and additional wait duration are fulfilled.\n\nA/B testing in a Sunset journey scenario:\n\nAn A/B test block in a sunset journey will work the same as it does in a live version of a journey.\n\nOverriding the winning variant\n\nYou can override a winning variant within two days of the result.\nFor instance, if three variants (A, B, and C) were defined and Variant B is determined as the winner, but you prefer to send Variant C to customers entering the journey after the test, you can do so. Perform the following:\n\nNavigate to the Journey where the A/B test was set up and access the A/B test block. By default, the winning variant is selected.\n\nSelect Variant C and declare it as the final variant to be sent to all customers entering the journey.\n\nUpdated about 4 hours ago"}

These conditions serve as additional decision points that determine whether the user will continue on the same path or be directed to a different flow.\n\nThe various flow control blocks available are:\n\nTime-based wait\n\nEvent-based wait\n\nJoin\n\nDecision split\n\nTime-based wait\n\nThe time-based wait is used by brands to engage customers at a particular time/date or after a specified period. This is preferred after analyzing user behaviour and targeting users at a crucial time to improve engagement.\n\nThis feature allows brands to target their customers at the right time to increase engagement and can avoid spamming the customer. This can increase click-through rates and would motivate the target customer to perform a desired behaviour.\n\nUse Cases\n\nA brand has analyzed that their customers have high activity rates mostly on the weekends and they want to send out communication messages during that period.\n\nCertain countries have rules that engagements with customers should go out on particular days of the week/date of the month and rates for some days of the week are lower than the other. This would allow brands to comply with government rules and also save engagement costs\n\nConfiguring time-based wait\n\nDrag and drop the Wait block on the journey canvas.\n\nOn the journey canvas, click Time based wait .\n\nIn the Block name , enter a name for the wait block.\n\nDefine the wait duration.

It will continue from the remaining duration.\n\nEvent-based wait\n\nThis feature allows brands to configure user journeys based on the behaviour of the customer. Brands can configure separate paths for customers based on an event-based wait time. The wait can be configured in two ways - wait since event and wait till event.\n\nThis allows brands to personalize journeys for users who perform a desired action and for new users that are yet to act. This also reduces the redundancy of messages and eliminates sending irrelevant messages to users.\n\nUse Cases\n\nThe brand wants to give the customers a 10% off coupon if they make a purchase of 5000 within 30 days and if they do not make a purchase, the brand wants to share an upcoming offer message.\n\nThe brand wants to give customers a 10% off coupon after they have completed 90 days since the last purchase date.\n\nConfiguring event-based wait block\n\nTo configure the event-based wait block, follow these steps\n\nDrag and drop the Event based wait to the Journey canvas.\n\nSelect the Event based wait block on the canvas to open the configuration menu.\n\nIn the Block name text box, enter a name for the block.\n\nSelect the wait conditions from the Wait Type drop-down.

Brands can define multiple criteria and the customers will move in a path as per the criteria they fit in. This enables brands to target customers based on their past purchases and behavioural patterns which leads to extremely personalized journeys for users. It allows brands to create multiple paths for customers matching various criteria and to send out relevant engagement messages and nudges\n\nUse Cases\n\nIncentive customers based on their previous behaviour which will result in an increase in coupon redemption and increase transaction frequency. Brands will be able to send relevant messages to users based on their behavioural patterns and can increase personalisation.\n\nIncentivise customers on special days such as birthdays/anniversaries to make them feel special and increase loyalty towards the brand.\n\nSend customers wishes and offers based on the festivals celebrated in their respective regions.

Some of the salient features of JUmp block are:\n\nAllows marketing team to simplify their journey-designing process\n\nEliminates the redundancy of creating the same flows within multiple journeys by allowing users to jump from one journey to another if they meet certain conditions.\n\nThrough personalized journeys, you can ensure customer retention and satisfaction.\n\nAvoids the complications of creating a complex journey in a single flow and thus simplifies creating hyper-personalized journeys.\n\nAvoids monotony creating similar flows within each journey separately and saves time.\n\nUse Cases\n\nAssume that a brand wants to give customers who spend more than 1000 rs in their store 500 bonus points and certain other incentives. If a customer spends more than 5000$ in Journey A, they will jump to Journey B (elite customers) which includes customers that have a free membership + incentives. The brand can include a Jump activity within their journey A that caters to the value of a transaction.\n\nConfiguring a jump block\n\nDrag and drop the Jump block to end of the path on the journey canvas. Whenever a user reaches this block, they will be directed to a different journey as per the configuration in the Jump block.\n\nClick on the Jump block in the canvas.\n\nIn the Block name text box, enter a name for the block.\n\nFrom the drop-down, select the desired existing journey. You can also use the search box and search for a particular journey.  You can click on the info icon and  view the summary of the selected journey\n\nClick Done\n\nTo view a summary of the added journey, click on the info icon below the Jump block. The summary block displays the entry trigger and duration of the journey.\n\nOnce the wait block is added to the canvas, click on the delete icon to remove the block or click on the setting icon to edit the block.\n\nIssue incentive\n\nAttention\n\nBy default, this block is not available for all orgs. Contact your CSR for enabling this block.\n\nThe Incentives block allows you to reward customers during their journey without sending a communication. This can be used by brands which run multiple offers and incentives not to spam their customers with numerous notifications.\n\nTo issue incentives without sending a communication, perform the following while configuring the journey:\n\nDrag and drop the Incentives block to the Journey.\n\nClick on the Incentives block.\n\nIn the Incentive configuration page, enter a name for the Incentive.\n\nAdd the desired incentive and select Done . You can add only one incentive for an Issue Incentives block. An error message will be displayed if the attached incentive is already claimed. In addition, claims such as cart promotion are claimed after the Journey is approved and not while sent for approval.\n\nYou can edit or remove the configured incentive while editing the Journey. The configured incentives will be displayed when previewing the Journey.\n\nWebhook\n\nThe webhook block enables your Journeys to send and receive information in real-time through a webhook. You can use this block to capture specific details during a customer journey and send them to external third-party systems for further processing.\n\nFor example, if you use an external service to issue coupons, you can configure the journey to trigger their webhook when a specific event occurs, such as a customer completing a purchase. The event data is sent to the external service through their webhook, and the service then processes the information independently to issue a coupon to the customer.\n\nThe webhook block supports POST and PUT HTTP methods. You can configure it with query parameters , headers , and a JSON payload to send data to external systems.\n\nAttention\n\nBy default, this block is not available for all orgs. Contact your CSR for enabling this block.\n\nUse cases\n\n1.

Customer {{profile.email}} just made a purchase of ₹{{trigger.purchase_amount}}!\"\n}\n\nOutcome: Your team sees a real-time notification in Slack the moment the high-value purchase is made.\n\n3. Update Customer Preferences in Your CRM\n\nScenario: A customer is in a re-engagement journey and clicks a button to update their email frequency preference to \"weekly.\" You need to update their profile in your CRM to reflect this change.\n\nConfiguration:\n\nMethod: PUT\n\nURL: https://your-company.crm.com/members/{memberId}updateEmail\n\nQuery parameters: reason : journey-preference-update (This adds a tracking parameter, useful for creating an audit log in your CRM to know why this record was updated.)\n\nJSON body: JSON {\n  \"tags\": {\n    \"frequency\": \"weekly\"\n  },\n  \"status_if_new\": \"subscribed\"\n}\n\nOutcome: The customer's profile in the CRM is updated, ensuring they receive emails at their preferred frequency.\n\n4. Sync a Customer's Tier Status to Your Support Desk\n\nScenario: Based on loyalty points accumulated, a customer is promoted to \"Gold Tier\" within a journey. To ensure they receive priority support, you need to update their existing user profile in your Zendesk support desk.\n\nConfiguration:\n\nMethod: PUT\n\nURL: https://your-domain.zendesk.com/api/v2/users/{zendesk_user_id}\n\nJSON body: JSON {\n  \"user\": {\n    \"user_fields\": {\n      \"loyalty_tier\": \"Gold\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOutcome: The customer's user record in Zendesk is updated with their new tier, and any support agent who views their profile will see they are a Gold Tier member.\n\nWebhook request structure\n\nThe webhook supports POST and PUT http methods and also spports query parameter, header and the JSON payload.\n\nQuery parameters\n\nQuery parameters are simple key-value pairs appended to the end of a URL. They provide visible, top-level context about the request.\n\nFor example, if a customer adds a product from the Electronics category to their cart, the webhook can include this information as a query parameter, such as category=electronics. The external coupon service can then use this parameter to identify the product category and issue a coupon that’s valid for purchases in the Electronics section\n\nHeaders\n\nHeaders provide technical instructions and metadata for the receiving server on how to process an incoming request.\n\nUse headers for authentication and for specifying the data format. For example, use the Authorization header to securely pass an API key or bearer token. Use the Content-Type header with a value like application/json to inform the server that the payload is structured as JSON.\n\nPayload (request body)\n\nThe payload, also referred to as the request body, is the primary content of the message. It contains the detailed, structured information for the external system to process, especially when using POST or PUT methods.\n\nUse the payload to send complex, multi-field, or sensitive data. For example, when creating a support ticket, the customer's email, the ticket subject, and the comment are structured within the JSON payload. Because the payload is not visible in the URL, it is a secure and appropriate place for detailed customer or event information. You can also use Labels and add them as variables to add information dynamically.\n\nConfigure the webhook block\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore configuring the webhook block, obtain the following from the external system you want to connect to.\n\nEndpoint URL: The specific URL that will receive the data.\n\nHTTP Method: The required method for the webhook.\n\nAuthentication Details: The credentials needed to access the webhook securely.\n\nJSON Data Structure: The JSON payload for the webhook.\n\nTo configure the webhook block, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Block Name box, enter a descriptive name for the webhook block. For example: Create Ticket - Zendesk or Update Lead - Salesforce .\n\nIn the Block Name box, enter a descriptive name for the webhook block.

You can add a label, such as \"First Name\", as a variable value. For more information, refer to the documentation on Labels .\n\nOn the Settings tab, enter the rate limit (requests per minute).\n\nOn the Settings tab, enter the rate limit (requests per minute).\n\nNote\n\nThis prevents your Journey from overwhelming the receiving system with too many requests at once, which could cause your webhook to be blocked. Check the third-party service's API documentation for their recommended rate limits.\n\nSelect Done to save your changes.\n\nNote\n\nThe webhook block cannot be edited once the journey has been sent for approval. To make changes, reject the approval request and make the changes.\n\nConfiguring authorization\n\nThe Authorization tab allows you to specify the credentials the webhook will use. The correct method depends on the requirements of the third-party service. The following types are supported:\n\nNone : No authorisation.\n\nBasic Auth : A simple username and password combination.\n\nAPI Key : A unique key that you pass in either the headers or parameters. For example, a header named X-API-Key with your key as the value.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich HTTP methods are supported?\nThe webhook block supports POST and PUT methods.\n\nWhat authentication methods are supported?\nThe webhook block supports basic authorization.\n\nHow many headers or params can I add?\nYou can add up to 10 headers and 10 params per request.\n\nWhat happens if I add unsupported tags in the request?\nThe request returns a 400 error, and the UI displays an error message stating that the tags are not supported.\n\nDoes editing a webhook block in a live journey create a new version of the journey?\nYes. Editing a block in a live journey creates a new version, which then enters the approval flow.\n\nCan I edit the configuration once the journey has been sent for approval?\nThe webhook block cannot be edited once the journey has been sent for approval. To make changes, reject the approval request and make the changes.\n\nUpdated about 3 hours ago"}

This calls for a tedious process from the marketer’s side while also creating a possible overlap of audience with them receiving the incentive or communication more than the intended number of times.\n\nWith the help of Edit feature, brands can easily edit a live journey without the hassle of creating a new one from scratch.\n\nEditing a live journey\n\nUser will be able to modify the contents/configuration of any blocks however you cannot change the structure of the block(add/move/delete any flow control blocks). The following are the editable items within each block in the journey canvas\n\nComponent\n\nEditable items\n\nEntry trigger (User event)\n\nIf the selection is User Event\n\nOnly values within conditions can be edited\n\nOnly values within conditions can be edited\n\nPaths, conditions or groups cannot be added or edited If the selection is Audience List\n\nPaths, conditions or groups cannot be added or edited If the selection is Audience List\n\nA new audience group can be added\n\nA new audience group can be added\n\nPreviously added audience list cannot be edited or removed\n\nPreviously added audience list cannot be edited or removed\n\nExclude audience list can be added\n\nExclude audience list can be added\n\nEngagement blocks (SMS, Email, M-push)\n\nInterchangeable with another engagement block. For example, if you have selected an SMS block, you can replace it with an Email block.\n\nWithin any engagement block,\n\nName and content can be edited and changed\n\nIncentives can be added and/or removed while editing\n\nDelivery Settings of the engagement can also be changed\n\nTime based wait\n\nBlock name is editable\n\nTime duration is editable\n\nImplementation condition is editable\n\nEvent based wait\n\nBlock name can be edited\n\nPaths, conditions or groups cannot be added or edited\n\nValue within any condition is editable\n\nTime duration is editable\n\nDecision Split\n\nCannot be edited\n\nJoin\n\nCannot be edited\n\nJump\n\nBlock name is editable\n\nDestination journey can be changed to nowhere or a different journey, meaning if you want to remove the Jump to another journey you should select the option “JUMP to nowhere”\n\nMessage Schedule\n\nCannot be edited\n\nExit Trigger\n\nOnly values within conditions can be edited\n\nPaths, conditions or groups cannot be added or edited\n\nTo edit a live journey, perform the following:\n\nGo to the live journey, click on Edit. Once you click on Edit (on Top right hand side), a new version of the existing journey will be created. Click on Yes to confirm.\n\nMake changes(as described in the Scope section) and click on Save and Exit\n\nOnce you edit a journey and click on Save and Send for approval, the journey will again be sent for approval and another version of the journey will be created. Let’s call the original version v0 and new version v1.\n\nAfter this, please refer to the next section to know how to approve an edited journey and what happens to the previous version.\n\nApproving an edited journey\n\nAs soon as the approver approves this new version (v1), they will be prompted with an option to select What should be the previous version behavior? Sunset, Stop or Pause\n\nMove customers to new version -  Existing customers who have joined journey v0 will be moved to journey v1 and will remain in the same block they were in.\n\nSunset - Customers who have entered v0 journey will continue to the journey v0 and new customers after v1 is made live, will now enter the journey v1.\n\nStop - v0 will be stopped for all customers. Customers who had entered the journey v0 will be exited from the journey. New customers will enter the journey v1.\n\nIf the marketer rejects the new version (v1), the original version (v0) will continue to be in a live state.\n\nNote : _At any point in time, only one version of a particular journey can be in a live state. Rest all versions can be either in Stop / Sunset / Draft / Awaiting approval / Rejected state but cannot be in Live state.\n\nPausing/Stopping/Sunsetting a Live Journey\n\nIn addition to editing a journey, users now also have an option to Pause a journey, sunset a journey or stop a journey. Please see below for more details on the behavior of the journey when either of these three options are selected:\n\nPause Journey: If a user pauses a current journey, it will be paused for all the customers currently in the journey. All the customers will continue to be in the journey however the next block of the journey will be executed only when the user “Resumes” the journey back.\n\nIn a paused journey state, no new customers will be allowed to enter a journey.\n\nResume a Journey: This option is only enabled when a journey has previously been paused. If a user resumes a paused journey, the current paused journey will get unpaused. The customers already in the journey will resume back from the stage where they were when the journey was paused and subsequent blocks of the journey will execute for them till the journey state is not changed again. New customers can now start entering this journey.\n\nStop a Journey: If a user selects the Stop option, the journey will be stopped and it will end for all the customers present in the journey. No new customers can enter this journey.\n\nPlease note this action cannot be reversed again. A journey once stopped cannot be made live again.\n\nSunset a Journey: If a user selects Sunset option, the journey will be stopped for all new customers. Meaning the customers who were already present in a journey only those will continue to be in that journey and it will continue for them as it is till the journey comes to an end for them. However, no new customers will be allowed in this journey anymore.\n\nFiltering the journeys by version status\n\nOn Journeys listing page, users will see an option to filter the journeys by Latest version status . As each journey now could have multiple versions, the filter works on what is the current status (Live/Draft/Sunset/Stop, etc. ) of the latest version of the journey (most recent version).\n\nOn the listing page of Journeys, under the Version count column, user will see following additional fields against each Journey - Total number of versions Latest version number (If total versions are 5, they are identified as v0, v1, v2, v3 and v4) Current status of the latest version - Here the latest version means the last created version\n\nTotal number of versions\n\nLatest version number (If total versions are 5, they are identified as v0, v1, v2, v3 and v4)\n\nCurrent status of the latest version - Here the latest version means the last created version\n\nAfter the user clicks on any journey, if a journey has multiple versions, a list with all the versions for that particular journey will be displayed. You can select any version to navigate to the canvas of that version.\n\nUpdated 2 months ago"}

It can be used when brands want to create journeys with similar structures but slight variations. This will help marketers to save time and effort.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIf the user wants to edit any message content or incentive of the existing journey, they can duplicate the existing journey and create it. Many times the changes are minute but the user has to redraw the entire journey again - which is time-consuming & error-prone.\n\nMany times the user wants different versions (slightly different from each other) of the journeys to test and compare results. For example, to compare revenue from 2 different versions of the journey.  For this, instead of creating a new journey, brands can copy a journey and then edit it For example,  Upsell journey & cross-sell journey can have the same journey design. Upsell contains incentives related to the same product and in cross-sell the product category or brand can be different.\n\nDuplicating a journey\n\nClick on the Journey that you need to duplicate.\n\nClick on the duplicate icon next to the save button within the journey canvas.\n\nIn the Duplicate this Journey dialogue box, click Yes, save and duplicate to confirm.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-sms-template-", "title": "Create SMS Template", "text": "Create SMS Template\n\nCreate SMS template for Indian Orgs (as per TRAI Regulations)\n\nTRAI has formulated certain guidelines to enhance control, prevent any fraudulent practice and provide greater safety to the end customer. As per the guidelines, the orgs that want to communicate with their customers will now have to register themselves with Telecom Operators for sending SMS. The system is governed using Blockchain technology also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAn Org should register itself on any of the DLT platforms and share the Entity ID with Capillary.\n\nNotes\n\nTo make an org DLT enabled, raise a ticket and tag the Engage+ Sustenance team requesting to enable the DLT settings.\n\nFor existing Orgs, this will be taken care of as part of the Feature rollout process.\n\nDLT settings have to be enabled only for Indian clients.\n\nAn org should register Headers/ Sender IDs on the DLT platform. Multiple sender IDs can be registered under an Entity ID depending on the type of message.\n\nNote\n\nOnce the Header is registered it needs to be shared with the Capillary Gateways team ( [email protected] ). The Gateways team will do the Domain and Gateway mapping. This step is internal to Capillary.\n\nOrg needs to register Content templates in the DLT platform.\n\nMessage categories\n\nFor DLT enabled organizations, the following are the three different SMS categories available.\n\nPromotional : Any message sent with an intention to promote or sell a product, goods, or service. Service content mixed with promotional content is also treated as promotional. Sender ID of 3-9 numeric digits needs to be used. Promotional messages sent to non-registered customers after receiving their consent will come under the category of Service Explicit.\n\nService Explicit : Any service message which doesn’t fall under the category of service message (inferred consent) will be considered a Service explicit message. To send such messages, the Sender ID of 3-9 alphabetic characters needs to be used. Promotional messages sent to registered customers after receiving their consent will come under the category of Service Explicit.\n\nService-Inferred/Implicit : Any message, arising out of the customer's actions or their relationship with the sender, that is not promotional, and is not in the interest of the customer to block. A sender ID of 3-9 alphabetic characters needs to be used. Notifications such as order confirmations, payment alerts, purchase updates, website/app login OTP, and other vital updates can be transmitted from Service Implicit route.\n\nUploading SMS template\n\nThe following are the key points to remember before uploading a file:\n\nYou can use only the templates that are currently active and approved by the DLT Portal.\n\nExisting templates with the same template ID will be overridden. For example, when you change a message related to a template ID in excel, it overrides the one which is in Engage+.\n\nDifferent DLT portals act differently and hence they can provide different CSV files. These may include whitespaces, curly braces({}), quotes(“”) or anything. Engage+ will take care of such things and trim the final file accordingly.\n\nTo upload an SMS template, follow the given steps:\n\nOn the dashboard, click Creatives and then click the SMS tab.\n\nClick Upload template .\n\nUpload the CSV file with all the required details.\n\nNotes\n\nUsers can upload a file containing DLT approved content templates by clicking on the Upload Template button.\n\nFollow all the mentioned instructions.\n\nThe template will be successfully uploaded after it gets approved by TRAI.\n\nOnly the templates with valid Template name, Template ID, Type, Sender ID, Approval status, Status, Template message will be saved in Engage+.\n\nClick Done .\n\nColumns of a CSV file:\n\nThe sample CSV file contains the following mandatory fields that you need to upload:\n\nTemplate ID : Unique ID of the template. It is a 19 or 20 digit unique numeric identifier which is provided by the DLT portal. Note: To avoid shortening your value(truncation), you should change the type to text\n\nTemplate name : Unique name of the respective template.\n\nType : Specify whether the template is promotional, service explicit or service implicit.\n\nHeader : Sender ID used for broadcasting each message.\n\nRegistered DLT : It consists of the registered DLT portal that is used for the template. For example, Vodafone Idea or Jio.\n\nApproval Status : The current status of the template from the DLT’s end - approved, pending, or rejected.\n\nActual Status : It specifies if the template is active or inactive in the DLT portal.\n\nTemplate message : It contains the actual template message that the end-user will receive.\n\nNote\n\nIf there is an error in any row of the uploaded file, the template in that row will not be saved in the Capillary system. However, the file containing error details can be downloaded to check the errors.\n\nGuidelines to add links in Template\n\nYou can also add links in the template message. In India, as there is DLT compliance, users need to ensure the following guidelines while adding a link in SMS:\n\nThe users need to add the link in the {#var#} tag only so that the whitelisted template does not get affected. This is due to DLT compliance restrictions and hence adding links outside the {#var#} tag will result in template mismatch leading to delivery failure.\n\nIf there are any recurring messages that have links in SMS, the link has to be added in the {#var#} tag.\n\nIf there are templates set for coupon expiry reminders or resend messages and has links, these links must be added in the {#var#} tag otherwise, the campaign will fail once the feature gets enabled for your ORG.\n\nTo know how the link works internally, see the following:\n\nThe system replaces the mentioned link with an internal tiny URL.\n\nThe link added by you will be transformed, that is the appearance of the link which has to be tracked would change. For example, if the link is www.google.com , it would be changed to s.cplry.com/7383936D89.\n\nThe changing of the link would also affect the characters of the SMS script. The replaced link would be 20-22 characters in length and hence the SMS character count can be changed by 15 characters (either add or remove). This could also affect the credits used for a particular SMS script.\n\nUsing approved templates\n\nOnce the file is successfully uploaded all the templates will be shown in Creatives > SMS.\n\nNote\n\nIn the campaign creation flow,  while adding creativity users can select any of the listed templates.\n\nSelecting the template will open the edit SMS screen. However, in the edit SMS screen, only the variable portion of the template can be edited.\n\nYou can replace the variables with static text or labels, but a maximum of 30 characters are allowed per variable {#var#} field. Hence, while adding text, users will be able to add a maximum of 30 characters. In case labels are used and a variable field resolves to more than 30 characters the message will fail for sure. Hence, the message for that user will be skipped by Engage+.\n\nNote\n\nIf length for any dynamic variable is more than 30 characters but less than 60, use {{var}} two times consecutively like {{var}}{{var}}. In that case, Engage+ will not skip the message. If the length is more than 60 characters but less than 90, use {{var}}{{var}}{{var}} and so on.\n\nYou can map a content template against multiple sender IDs.\n\nNotes\n\nThe DLT portal allows this.\n\nIn such a case the user will have to select one of the sender ids that’s tagged to the content from the delivery settings section\n\nIf any of the sender IDs tagged to the content is not shown in the dropdown it means that the sender ID is not registered with Capillary. The gateways team should be contacted to have that sender ID registered with Capillary.\n\nView the details of failed messages (if any)\n\nDetails on the percentage of message failures with corresponding reasons will be available both on Engage+ Message Summary Page and Member Care .\n\nMessages might not get delivered due to the following reasons.\n\nError related to DLT template\n\nError related to Sender ID\n\nCustomers in the NDNC list\n\nCreate SMS template for other Orgs\n\nTo create an SMS template for other organizations (non-Indian organizations) follow the given steps:\n\nOn the dashboard, click on the Creatives tab and then navigate to the SMS tab.\n\nIn the Content section, click Create New .\n\nEnter the Message .

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-email-settings", "title": "Configure Email Settings", "text": "Configure Email Settings\n\nConfigure domain gateway and sender details\n\nTo configure the domain gateway and sender details, create a ticket to the Capillary Gateway team. Provide the following information:\n\nCustom/Capillary IP : The IP address used for sending emails can be either a Custom IP (dedicated to the brand) or Capillary's IP. Well-established brands generally use a custom IP address. Brands new in their journey typically use the Capillary IP address to avoid sending emails to the Spam mail section. This choice is based on IP ranking, which is determined by email providers such as Gmail and Yahoo based on authenticity. Use dedicated IP (there is a cost @ 30 usd /IP/month). It is crucial to Never use the same IP for Bulk and High (OTP/Transactional) emails, always use a different IP for each traffic type. Use consistent sending IP addresses and domains for your bulk email, but do segment marketing and transactional email streams. Using shared IPs can lead to spamming issues, where spam was mostly due to shared IPs and partial warm-up. Dedicated IPs help segment email streams for better delivery rates.\n\nWell-established brands generally use a custom IP address.\n\nBrands new in their journey typically use the Capillary IP address to avoid sending emails to the Spam mail section.\n\nThis choice is based on IP ranking, which is determined by email providers such as Gmail and Yahoo based on authenticity.\n\nUse dedicated IP (there is a cost @ 30 usd /IP/month).

Use consistent sending IP addresses and domains for your bulk email, but do segment marketing and transactional email streams. Using shared IPs can lead to spamming issues, where spam was mostly due to shared IPs and partial warm-up. Dedicated IPs help segment email streams for better delivery rates.\n\nIf a client opts for a Custom IP, a relay ticket is generated to the gateways team. The Gateway team follows a specific convention for naming these domains, typically involving Intouch (our system) and Send Grid (vendor).\n\nA sub-account needs to be created on the vendor side.\n\nDNS records for the domains must be created.\n\nDNS details are to be added to the client panel and verified at the backend.\n\nYou must ensure the c names (SPF and DKIM) and DMARC values are added in client DNS . The best practice is that DMARC should be initially set to p=none and can be changed to quarantine or reject at a later stage. It is also vital to make use of **Sender Policy Framework (SPF) **and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) to authenticate your emails. Furthermore, reverse DNS to be done on parent account, and it's critical to ensure the relay is configured correctly by engineering.\n\nThe CSMs or the gateway team can enter the existing domain details in Org Settings > Domain Mapping+Channel Count Info .\n\nConfigure sender details\n\nDefine the following details in the JIRA ticket to proceed with the onboarding process:\n\nSender label/sender name : This represents the name by which clients wish to send emails to their customers. For example, \"Capillary tech.\" might use \"Capillary academy programs\" as their sender label when communicating about those programs.\n\nSender/Reply to ID : The Sender ID refers to the email ID that the organization wants to use to send the email (e.g., \" [email protected] \").\n\nThe organization has two options for replies:\n\nThey can either choose the sender ID itself to receive reply mail.\n\nThey can use a separate \"Reply to\" Email ID for receiving replies.\n\nNote\n\nUse a consistent from: name and address to clearly identify your brand. Consistency in sender identity builds trust and recognition.\n\nFor OTP (One-Time Password) & Transactional mails, enter details in Org Settings > Setup Wizard > Campaigns .\n\nNote\n\nAlways set up a different account for OTP/Transactional emails and Bulk traffic accounts because we cannot use 1 account for both bulk and high emails. This separation ensures reliable delivery for critical transactional emails by isolating them from bulk mailing practices.\n\nWhitelist Emails\n\nIn scenarios where emails experience soft or hard bounces, impacting delivery, it is necessary to whitelist such emails. These are emails that are unable to receive messages triggered from Capillary.\n\nThe process for whitelisting emails on the Capillary Engage+ setting is as follows:\n\nOn Engage+ select settings.\n\nNavigate to Email whitelisting .\n\nUpload the CSV file containing the emails to be whitelisted.\n\nClick Done.\n\nThe system now provides the option to upload and whitelist a larger quantity of emails at once.\n\nWhile whitelisting addresses specific delivery issues, it is part of a broader set of best practices for proactive customer database management. These include cleaning of the customer database, removing invalids, blocks etc. , having a standard policy for handling bouncing addresses, and periodically remove inactive subscribers from your list. It is also important to don't reactivate email addresses that are already on your unsubscribe or suppression list. Whitelisting acts as a remedial measure, but consistent database hygiene is crucial to prevent delivery problems in the first place.\n\nEmail Notifications to POCs\n\nSend to POCs : POCs (Point of Contacts) are the brand user group. Enable this option to send messages to the POCs as well. The messages will be sent based on the delivery schedule\n\nTo create a POCs group, follow these steps.\n\nOn the dashboard, click the settings icon.\n\nClick Users groups , and then click Create user group .\n\nIn Name , enter a group name for POCs users.\n\nIn the All contacts tab , select users by clicking +Add next to it, and then click Done .\n\nSubscription Update Language\n\nYou can control the language of the success or failure messages sent when a user clicks the Subscribe or Unsubscribe link in an email by using the CONF_ORG_SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE_MSG config. For details, refer to Subscription Message Language Configuration .\n\nOffer an unsubscribe link, so that the recipient can unsubscribe immediately. Not providing an unsubscribe option can send your emails straight to spam and compromises compliance.\n\nIt also reinforces the principle to send only to recipients who explicitly subscribed to your emails, ensuring consent and preventing issues from purchased or rented lists.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago"}

Can this be achieved by adding a prebuilt option within the email?\n\nA: No, adding a prebuilt option in the email to change a member’s program status is not possible. Member account deletion or status change can only be done through Member Care. From email, you can only capture opt-in/opt-out confirmations for subscriptions, which apply to communication preferences, not program status.\n\nQ2: A customer’s status was changed from Unsubscribed to Subscribed in Member Care, an email was sent but did not reach the customer. Does the status change take time to reflect, causing a delay in email delivery?\n\nA: Yes. Since the data is computed from Insights, it takes up to 24 hours for the update to reflect.\n\nQ3: How should the bounce “Email message does not meet the recipient server’s policies” be classified?\n\nA: This bounce is classified as a hard bounce. In Capillary reporting, a hard bounce is a permanent email delivery failure for example, when the recipient server rejects the message due to policy violations such as content restrictions, authentication issues, or security rules. For details, see the Reachability computation documentation.\n\nQ4: Is there a way to control or pass a customer’s language when sending emails through Engage+?\n\nA: Yes, but only for subscription emails. You can use the CONF_ORG_SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE_MSG config to pass a customer’s language. The system uses the request’s language code, else the default config, and defaults to English if none is set. For other types of emails, language control is not available. For details see Subscription Message Language Configuration .\n\nQ5: Is there documentation available for email tags, since the value names are unclear and may represent different values?\n\nA: Yes, documentation is available. For details, see Supported Labels for Engagement Channels .\n\nQ6: What can be done if a user does not receive the registration email?\n\nA: If the automatic registration email doesn’t arrive, you can send the invite link manually. The link is valid for 24 hours. If it expires, generate a new one. For details, see Sending User Registration Invite Link Manually .\n\nQ7: In the sendCommunication API, if HTML tags are included in the email body parameter, are they rendered as formatted content (HTML) in the email, or displayed as plain text?\n\nA: HTML in the email body is rendered as HTML (formatted content), not as plain text.

It is the same number that was shared with the BSP's (Tanla/Twilio/other) POC when filling in the onboarding details.\n\nWhatsApp Sender ID / Messaging SID :\n\nThis is the** client's official WhatsApp phone number**.\n\nIt is the same number that was shared with the BSP's (Tanla/Twilio/other) POC when filling in the onboarding details.\n\nAdd the Connection IDs To complete the account setup and fully configure the sender details, you must add specific connection IDs within the product UI:\n\nNavigate to Org settings ->** Channel configurations** -> Search for Whatsapp .\n\nAdd the relevant Connection IDs as provided by the BSP. These include: Access token Source Account ID\n\nAccess token\n\nSource Account ID\n\nConfigure Domain Gateway (Adding the DLT Endpoint in the Karix UI)\n\nThis involves setting up a Delivery Report (DLR) endpoint in the Karix UI, which acts as a gateway for delivery receipts, ensuring that status updates for sent messages are properly routed.\n\nGo to the Karix Portal : Access the portal using the same login credentials as used for the Karix Lounge.\n\nNavigate to Webhook Configuration : On the left-hand side, choose WhatsApp Campaigns > Webhook Config > Delivery Rule > Create New .\n\nAdd the DLT Endpoint URL : Click on \"Create New\" and input the DLT endpoint URL into the designated space.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-whatsapp-template", "title": "Create WhatsApp Template", "text": "Create WhatsApp Template\n\nTo create Whatsapp template follow the given steps\n\nOn the Creatives page, navigate to the WhatsApp tab. If multiple gateway accounts are configured, a list of available gateway options will be displayed.\n\nNote\n\nTo configure multiple channels on WhatsApp, you have to raise a Jira ticket to Gateway team.\n\nOnce a gateway account is selected, all templates associated with that gateway will be displayed, along with existing options like Create , Filter, and Search .\n\nClick on Create new.\n\nIn the Template name box, enter a unique name and it can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).\n\nTip\n\nUse a name that helps WhatsApp’s reviewer understand the purpose of your message, for example \"order_delivery\" rather than \"template_1\"\n\nIn the Message language , select the desired language.\n\nIn Template category, select the template category from the options available. Your WhatsApp message templates need to be aligned with one of the following categories. Templates that do not align clearly with the specified template type are more likely to be rejected by WhatsApp during the template approval process.\n\nUtility: Share account updates, order updates, alerts and more to share important information.\n\nMarketing: Send promotional offers, product announcements, and more to increase engagement and awareness. If you want to add multiple images, you can choose Carousel as the media type, and add multiple images to your template. Start by adding the first image along with the body text and other required details, then save it. Once saved, you'll be able to add additional images to the carousel.\n\nAuthentication : This communication includes personal authentication information such as receiving OTPs from brands.\n\nIn Message, type a relevant message that you want to send. The message content should be as per the template category.\n\nCustom tags in message: WhatsApp does not support custom tags. If you want to use custom tags in the template, replace tag names with numeric values in a sequential order. Once the template is approved, you can replace numeric values with the actual tags before sending.\nFor example, If your message is: Hi { \\{firstname}} , here is your voucher {{voucher_code}} for our EOSS.\nYou need to send it as: Hi {{1}}, here is your voucher {{2}} for our EOSS.\n\nSupport for Special Characters: WhatsApp supports special characters in message templates. This ensures that messages are displayed correctly across all devices, improving readability and preventing formatting issues in customer communications.\nFor example: Hi {{1}}, your payment of ₹1,250 has been received successfully.\nDear {{1}}, your transaction ID {{2}} for ₹500 on 12 March 2025 was successful.\n\nAdd links in your template: You may send URLs in a template. For example, “Thanks for registering with Demo Business. To continue, click on < https://app.example.com” >. For recipients to see the preview of the link in the message, you need to have an Official WhatsApp Business Account.\n\nHeader and footer in messages: You can use the header and footer message option to keep the conversation engaging. For example, if you set the header \"Hi {{firstname}} \" and footer \"Get well soon\", the message appears as shown in the below figure:\n\nNote\n\nAs per the Meta policy, you can add a maximum of one variable for the header. For the footer there is no variable option.\n\nQuick reply in messages - You can add quick reply to send pre-defined responses or actions with a single tap. This helps to get more number of responses and saves time for the user.\n\nNotes\n\nYou can select the content language provided by WhatsApp.\n\nYou can upload a image with a size limit of up to 5MB. Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG.\n\nYou can upload a video with a file size limit of up to 16MB. Supported Format: MP4.\n\nYou can upload a document with a size limit up to 16MB. Supported Format: PDF.\n\nClick on Send for approval.\nCapillary then sends the template to WhatsApp for approval. You can check the status of the template:\n\nAwaiting Approval: The template is under review and yet to be approved by WhatsApp as per their norms. (Orange dot)\n\nApproved: The template has been approved successfully. You can start using approved templates.  (Green dot)\n\nRejected: The template is not approved. Check if the template is as per the WhatsApp guidelines. Modify the template accordingly and send it for approval again. (Red dot)\n\nMessage template approval criteria\n\nYour template text should make it clear to the end-user why they received your message.\n\nTips and guidelines\n\nHere are some guidelines for increasing the odds of getting your template approved:\n\nPlaceholders must have double curly braces, such as {{1}} ; single curly braces will not work.\n\nTemplates must have a specific, self-evident purpose.\nFor example: “{{1}} {{2}}” would be rejected because it could be abused to spam users. You need to surround the parameters with information so that it’s clear what type of information will be inserted.\n\nTemplates should be concise and convey only the necessary information that aligns with the template category. We suggest getting feedback from others to ensure that the template text is clear.\n\nTemplates must not have any grammatical or spelling mistakes. Templates that include even minor spelling or grammatical mistakes are likely to be rejected by WhatsApp.\n\nTemplates should be tagged with the appropriate category and language.\n\nOnce the template is approved, it is available in the WhatsApp tab and has a green dot next to it indicating that the template has been approved. You can then use it to broadcast messages to your customer base. You can also change the dynamic tags after the template has been approved accordingly.\n\nNote\n\nOnce you submit a template, it cannot be edited.\n\nProbable reasons for template rejection\n\nThe message template(s) contain content that violates WhatsApp’s Commerce Policy.\n\nThe message template(s) contain content that violates WhatsApp’s Business Policy\n\nDo not request sensitive identifiers from users. For example, do not ask people to share full length individual payment card numbers, financial account numbers, National Identification numbers, or other sensitive identifiers. This also includes not requesting documents from users that might contain sensitive identifiers.\n\nA survey after an experience is fine, but do not submit a survey or poll to collect unrelated data from users.\nExample: “Hi, we're interested in knowing how you feel about certain food groups. Do you mind participating in a survey?”\n\nThe message template(s) contain potentially abusive or threatening content\n\nExamples of approved and rejected message templates\n\nApproved message templates\n\nWelcome {{1}}.

We look forward to serving you on WhatsApp.\"\n\nCreating an order confirmation message where the message template name is Payment_confirmation and the message is \" We have received a payment of {{1}}} for your order no. {{1}}.”\n\nIn the Template category , select the template category from the options available. Your WhatsApp message templates need to be aligned with one of the following categories. Templates that do not align clearly with the specified template type are more likely to be rejected by WhatsApp during the template approval process.\n\nTransactional: Share account updates, order updates, alerts and more to share important information.\n\nMarketing: Send promotional offers, product announcements, and more to increase engagement and awareness\n\nOTP : It allows you to alert your customers about various updates like shipping, ticket and transportation, reservation, etc.\n\nIn the Message language , select the desired language.\n\nIn the Media , select the type of media.

For example, if you set the header \"Hi {{firstname}} \" and footer \"Get well soon\", the message appears as shown in the below figure:\n\nNote\n\nAs per the Meta policy, you can add a maximum of one variable for the header. For the footer there is no variable option.\n\nButtons(optional): Clickable buttons that will appear below your message.\n\nNone - You can select None if you don’t want to display any buttons below your message.\n\nCall to action - Choose the type of action you want the button to perform.\n\nNote\n\nYou can now use tags in the Website URL of WhatsApp CTA buttons by selecting the Dynamic option. This allows you to personalize URLs for each customer, such as including a customer ID or offer code in the link.\n\nQuick reply in messages - You can add quick reply to send pre-defined responses or actions with a single tap. This helps to get more number of responses and saves time for the user.\n\nCustom tags in messages: Whatsapp does not support custom tags. If you want to use custom tags in the template, replace tag names with numeric values in sequential order. Once the template is approved, you can replace numeric values with the actual tags before sending. For example, If your message is: Hi \\{\\{firstname}} , here is your voucher {{voucher_code}} for our EOSS.\nYou need to send it as: Hi {{1}}, here is your voucher {{2}} for our EOSS.\n\nAdd links in your template: You may send URLs in a template. For example, “Thanks for registering with Demo Business. To continue, click on https://app.example.com .

Push Notifications effectively reach customers, keeping them engaged and informed about your campaigns.\n\nPush notifications serve several key purposes:\n\nInforming: Delivering important updates or alerts to users in real-time. These notifications can alert users to updates, confirmations, reminders, or time-sensitive events. Ensure the information is clear and concise to keep users informed without overwhelming them.\n\nEngaging: Encouraging user interaction with the app through time-sensitive and relevant messages. They can be used to notify users of relevant activities, updates, or available actions. By providing timely and useful information, these notifications keep users actively involved with the app’s features and functionalities.\n\nRe-engaging: Encourage inactive users to return to the app with personalized content or offers. Remind users of pending actions, suggest personalized content, or offer incentives to return. Re-engagement notifications are a useful strategy to reduce app abandonment and maintain user interest.\n\nPromoting: Highlighting new features, products, or promotions to drive user engagement. Use these notifications to generate excitement and drive sales. Ensure your promotional messages are clear and concise to capture attention without overwhelming users.\n\nTypes of Push Notification\n\nStandard Push Notifications\n\nBasic text-based notifications that appear in the notification center. These are useful for simple alerts, reminders, and updates. For example a user receives a notification saying, \"Your order has been shipped .\" This provides a simple update without requiring the user to open the app.\n\nImage Notifications\n\nNotifications with an embedded image that appear in the notification center. These are useful for visual promotions and driving engagement. For example Users can receive an image notification in the notification center, such as a promotional banner saying, \"Flat 10% off on electronics!,\" with an eye-catching product image.\n\nRich Notification\n\nAdvanced notifications that include interactive elements such as Call to Action (CTA) buttons, quick replies or input fields. These enable user interaction within the notification to encourage user engagement. For example users can receive a rich notification in the notification center from an electronic store saying \"Flat 10%off on electronics. Explore now,\"  with interactive buttons for exploring product details, checking availability, or contacting customer support directly.\n\nThis section explains the essential elements of push notifications: deep external links, obtaining user permissions, managing push tokens, and adhering to platform regulations. Understanding these elements will help you create effective and compliant push notifications.\n\nElements of Push Notification\n\nDeep links and External links\n\nDeep links\n\nA deep link sends users directly to a specific in-app location or landing page. When users click on an interactive element, such as a rich notification or link, it redirects them to the specified app screen or functionality.\n\nExternal links\n\nAn external link sends users to an external website.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/rcs", "title": "RCS", "text": "RCS\n\nIntroduction\n\nRCS is a next-generation SMS protocol that upgrades text messages with rich features like branding, media, and analytics. It is aimed to replace SMS with a richer text format.\n\nRCS combines the messaging features of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger but delivered through the default SMS messaging app. RCS is delivered as an SMS but supports extensive media support such as images, videos, branding, CTAs (Call to Actions) and more. Unlike SMS, RCS facilitates you to track the metrics of the message like open rate and link click rate.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, RCS is only supported for Android devices through Google Messaging App. By default, this app is available in most of the Android devices. Customers can also download it from the Play Store if needed.\n\nCapillary provides various communication channels (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) to engage with brands' customers. With the advancing trends, it becomes very important to reach out to customers efficiently,  capture their attention, and keep them engaged.\n\nFeatures of RCS\n\nAllows brands to send media messages such as images, videos, and carousel media messages, add CTA buttons in messages. It also has better UX.\n\nEnables brands to have their verified profile, business profile picture, and bio which increases the brand’s verifiability.\n\nRCS offers detailed analytics of executed campaigns. This includes messages delivered, opened and link click rates.\n\nCapillary allows brands to configure fallback SMS within an RCS Campaign so that users who are not reachable on RCS can be automatically reached out through SMS. Fallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user. Brands can easily reach out to all customers through one campaign and do not need to run separate campaigns for RCS and SMS. A possible small set of users who might not receive will directly get an SMS, so communication to each user is done through one campaign.\n\nFallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user.

Hence, brands can leverage it to reach out to customers who are not reachable on another channel.\n\nAdvantages of using Capillary RCS\n\nBrands can attach and issue offers to customers and engage on the RCS channel.\n\nBrands can segment target users and runs RCS campaigns, which yields better ROI.\n\nProvides a detailed analytics of campaign performance, user-level insights, purchase pattern, and ROI from both the online and offline world which helps brands to take data-backed decisions.\n\nProvides fallback SMS functionality - brands can run a single RCS campaign to target all sets of customers and customers who are not reachable on RCS will receive an SMS.\n\nThere is no mandatory optout tag or approved templates required.\n\nOnboarding a brand\n\nTo enable RCS for a brand, you would need to fill in the onboarding form and send it to the RCS team  with the subject {Capillary Technology | RCS Account | brand name}.\n\nWe would then share the details with the Karix team for next steps and update you once the account is created.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/in-app-message-", "title": "In-app Message", "text": "In-app Message\n\nIn-app messages are pop-up messages that appear when a customer is actively using the app. Unlike push notifications, which can appear whether the customer is active or inactive, in-app messages are triggered only during active app sessions. Powered by Capillary's SDK, these messages can be configured and used in campaigns. They support various use cases such as displaying a message when a customer launches the app within a specific date range or shares a product with a friend.\n\nTypes of In-app messages\n\nModal\n\nModals are centrally positioned messages that appear with a background, drawing the user's full attention. They're ideal for highlighting time-sensitive offers, important updates, or feature announcements that require immediate user focus.\n\nBanner\n\nBanner messages appear either at the top or bottom of the app screen (you can set this when you create your message). They're well-suited for sharing brief updates, such as policy changes, cookie usage, or other important notices that don't interrupt the user’s flow.\n\nTop Banner\n\nTop banners appear at the top of the app screen, making them ideal for quickly grabbing attention without fully interrupting the user's activity. These are effective for highlighting updates, limited-time offers, or important announcements.\n\nBottom Banner\n\nBottom banners display at the bottom of the screen. They allow users to continue engaging with the app while staying informed.\n\nFull Screen\n\nFull-screen messages cover the entire device screen, making them highly effective when you need to capture the user’s full attention. They’re well-suited for critical communications, such as mandatory app updates, major announcements, or onboarding walkthroughs.\n\nElements of In app message\n\nThis section explains the essential elements of InApp messaging: deep linking to app screens, managing display conditions, and aligning with app behavior and user permissions. Understanding these will help you deliver contextually relevant and engaging messages.\n\nDeep links and External links\n\nDeep link\n\nA deep link opens a specific screen or feature within the app. When users tap a button in the Inapp message, it redirects them to a predefined section such as a product page, coupon wallet, or order tracking screen.\n\nExternal link\n\nAn external link opens a website or another app when clicked. For example, a promotional In app message may include a CTA button that opens a brand’s website or a third-party page in the device browser.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

Can this be achieved by adding a prebuilt option within the email?\n\nA: No, adding a prebuilt option in the email to change a member’s program status is not possible. Member account deletion or status change can only be done through Member Care. From email, you can only capture opt-in/opt-out confirmations for subscriptions, which apply to communication preferences, not program status.\n\nQ3: Is it possible to import WhatsApp creatives in bulk on the Engage platform, instead of uploading them individually?\n\nA: No, bulk import of WhatsApp creatives is not supported.\n\nQ4: A brand was targeting around 75,000 unique customers, but after some recipients blocked the number due to irrelevant content, WhatsApp reduced the brand’s messaging limit. Approximately how many unique customers can the brand now target?\n\nA: WhatsApp can reduce the messaging limit if many users block or report the brand. However, WhatsApp does not disclose a specific number or percentage for the new limit.\n\nQ5: A customer’s status was changed from Unsubscribed to Subscribed in Member Care, an email was sent but did not reach the customer. Does the status change take time to reflect, causing a delay in email delivery?\n\nA: Yes. Since the data is computed from Insights, it takes up to 24 hours for the update to reflect.\n\nQ6: If a brand’s WhatsApp limit is set to 1,000 unique customers for the first two weeks and they complete their quota (already sent messages to 1,000 unique customers) within the first week, when is the earliest they can send a message to a new customer?\n\nA: The earliest a brand can send a message to a new customer is after the two-week (14-day) limit period resets. The communication limit is enforced for the entire set period, so once the quota is reached, no new unique customers can be messaged until the next period begins. For more information refer to Set up communication limits for each channel .\n\nQ7: How should the bounce “Email message does not meet the recipient server’s policies” be classified?\n\nA: This bounce is classified as a hard bounce. In Capillary reporting, a hard bounce is a permanent email delivery failure for example, when the recipient server rejects the message due to policy violations such as content restrictions, authentication issues, or security rules.

The selected coupons will not be sent to the customers who have received these coupons in the past 6 months.\n\nEnable “ maximum issuals per customer ” to set the maximum number of coupons to be issued to each customer and the minimum gap (number of days) between two consecutive coupon issues and Enter the maximum number of coupons a customer can receive. If you do not want to set a limit, choose “ No Limit. \"\n\nSelect If a customer matches the criteria again .\n\nSelect Send existing valid coupon to send the same coupon again.\n\nSelect Do not send any coupon to ignore sending any coupon.\n\nEnable “ limit total issuals from the offer? ” and enter the number of limits that you can restrict the maximum coupon to be issued in an offer and configure notifications and then Enable “ send notification for issual limit ” and enter the number of remaining coupons that should trigger the notification. You can notify brand POCs when the coupon issual limit is about to reach a certain threshold value. The notification is sent to the brand POCs through email.\n\nEnable “ limit total issuals from the offer? ” and enter the number of limits that you can restrict the maximum coupon to be issued in an offer and configure notifications and then Enable “ send notification for issual limit ” and enter the number of remaining coupons that should trigger the notification.\n\nYou can notify brand POCs when the coupon issual limit is about to reach a certain threshold value. The notification is sent to the brand POCs through email.\n\nEnable “ sms content for resending the coupon ” to resend coupons via SMS if a customer missed them.

Then Set the number of days before which message is to be sent, the message channel and the specific time. Similarly, you can add multiple reminders using the +Reminder option.\n\nConfiguring the redemption settings\n\nTo configure various redemption limits and rules for how and when coupons can be redeemed, perform the following :\n\nEnable Coupon can be shared and redeemed by anyone to allow redemption of a coupon by anyone, for example friends and family. You can limit the number of times the coupon is redeemed. This additionally also gives access to set limits on Coupon code limit . You need to issue the coupon to at least one user to enable it for redemption by any customer.\n\nConfigure the coupon code limits under Coupon code limit, Individual customer limit and Across customer limit.\n\nCoupon code limit - The 'coupon code limit' feature allows brands to set a maximum number of times a specific coupon code can be redeemed across all customers. This ensures that once the set limit is reached, the code can no longer be used, regardless of how many different customers attempt to redeem it.\nUSECASE: A brand runs a promotion using the coupon code \"SUMMER50\", offering a 50% discount. Without a coupon code limit, an unlimited number of customers could redeem the code, potentially leading to higher-than-expected discounts.\nBy setting a coupon code limit of 1,000 redemptions, the brand ensures that only the first 1,000 customers can use the code. Once the limit is reached, the code becomes invalid, preventing excessive discount usage.\n\nIndividual customer limit - The 'Individual customer limit' feature allows brands to set the maximum number of times a single customer can redeem a specific coupon code. Once a customer reaches their redemption limit, they cannot use the code again, even if the coupon is still available for other customers.\nUSECASE 1: A brand offers a \"WELCOME10\" coupon that gives a 10% discount on purchases. To prevent misuse, they set the Individual customer limit to 1.\nThis ensures that each customer can only use the coupon once, even though the code may still be available for others. This helps the brand maintain the promotion’s intended purpose—rewarding new customers without allowing repeated use by the same person.\nUSECASE 2: In the case of the Step Function, the limit should be set to no limit because the number of coupons issued depends on the transaction amount and cannot be predetermined. However, the redemption limit can be set depending on how many times a particular issued coupon can be redeemed. To know more about Step Function, click here .\n\nAcross customer limit -\nThe 'Across customer limit' feature controls the total number of redemptions allowed across all coupon codes within a specific series. This ensures that once the predefined limit is reached, no additional redemptions can occur, even if individual codes or customers still have remaining redemption allowances.\nThis is particularly useful for large-scale promotions where multiple codes are distributed but the brand wants to cap the overall number of discounts given out. It provides a way to manage total redemptions across a campaign while still allowing flexibility at the individual coupon and customer levels.\nUSECASE: A brand launches a holiday sale where they distribute 5,000 unique coupon codes, each offering a discount.\nTo control the total discount given, they set a Series-Level Limit of 50,000 redemptions. This means that even though each individual code may have its own redemption limit, once the total redemptions across all codes in the series reach 50,000, no further redemptions will be allowed.\nThis helps the brand manage the overall budget for the promotion while still allowing multiple customers to redeem different codes.\n\nThe redemption limit settings are as follows:\n\nIn Redemption can start You can set when a coupon becomes available for redemption by setting the start time.\n\nEnable “Allow a coupon to be redeemed more than once ” to allow a customer to redeem the coupon more than once then Enable “ Limit the maximum times a customer can redeem a coupon” to set the maximum number of times the coupon can be redeemed by a customer. In  Limit to, enter the maximum number of times the coupon can be redeemed by a customer.\n\nIn  “ Stores allowing redemption ” You can restrict an offer to be redeemed at specific stores by selecting the stores or uploading a list of stores. Select tills/stores/concepts/ zones From the “ Restrict stores allowing redemptions “section. By default, an offer is available for redemption at any store.\n\nChoose Upload CSV file to upload a file containing the IDs of your preferred zones/stores/concepts.\n\nChoose Select Values to select your preferred zones/stores/concepts from the list directly. Till -> fetches the series for the till IDs, Store -> fetches for that individual store, Zone -> fetches the series mapped to zone, Concept -> fetches for the series mapped to concept.\n\nIn Bill Amount that can redeem the coupon You can restrict the minimum and maximum bill amount criteria for offer eligibility that Enable “ Minimum bill amount” enter the minimum amount and Enable “Maximum bill amount ” and enter the maximum amount. The coupon can be redeemed only if your bill amount is under the limitation.\n\nIn Days & time when the coupon can be redeemed You can set a specific day, date, and time slot for the coupon to be redeemed by selecting the following:\n\nDays of the week - To allow redemption on selected days of the week- Sunday to Saturday.\n\nDays of the month - To allow redemption on selected days of a month - 1st - 31st.\n\nHours of the day - To allow redemption in the preferred hours of the day.\n\nIn Require gap between the redemption of a customer You can set a minimum gap (number of days) between two consecutive redemptions. For that Enable “ Require gap between redemptions of a customer ” and Enter minimum days between redemption.\nNote: This option is not applicable if the coupon is restricted to redeemed only once.\n\nIn Limit total redemption in the offer You can limit the maximum number of coupon redemption in an offer and set the maximum allowed coupon redemption number. Enable “Limit total redemptions in the offer” and Enter the number of maximum allowed customers.\n\nIn Restrict to new customer you can restrict coupon redemptions to new or first-time customers based on their registration date or a number of transactions Click “ Restrict to new customer ”, Enable “ Date of registration ” and enter the start and end date then Enable “ Number of transactions ” and enter the value.\n\nRevoke coupon\n\nWhen a cashier redeems a coupon in case of an internet outage, you can expire such coupons instead of doing a manual cleanup at the backend.\nTo expire active coupons, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to Engage+ and Select Incentives .\n\nClick the three dots next to the offer you want to revoke.\n\nClick Revoke Coupons.\n\nSelect your desired revoking option.

Expired coupons cannot be redeemed or reversed.\n\nClick Revoke .\n\nClick Revoke .\n\nA message is shown that the customer data is successfully uploaded. All the coupons issued to the selected customer are revoked and ready for use.\n\nNotes: You cannot revoke redeemed coupons. If a customer has multiple active coupons from the same series, then all active coupons are revoked.\n\nTransfer of Coupon\n\nYou can revoke the coupon and then assign the same coupon code to the intended customer through coupon upload, as transferring a coupon from one customer to another customer is not supported.\n\nRevoke coupons with returned transactions\n\nWhen a transaction is returned, the system automatically revokes any coupons issued against it. This prevents customers from misusing benefits tied to invalid purchases and maintains program integrity. The process is triggered by a return transaction event notification.\n\nKey APIs used\n\nGet Customer Coupons V2\n\nRevoke Coupon\n\nWorkflow\n\nA return transaction generates an event notification.\n\nThe Neo workflow captures the transaction ID from the event.\n\nThe workflow calls Get Customer Coupons V2 API to retrieve coupons linked to the transaction ID.\n\nThe workflow extracts the coupon ID.\n\nThe workflow calls the Revoke Coupon API to revoke the coupon.\n\nStep 1: Capture the transaction ID\n\nWhen a return transaction event is triggered, Neo captures the transaction ID from the payload.\nYou will map this field in your Neo workflow configuration.\n\nStep 2: Get Customer Coupons\n\nUse the Get Customer Coupons V2 API to retrieve all coupons linked to the captured transaction ID.\n\nRequest\n\nResponse\n\nStep 3:Revoke Coupon\n\nUse the couponId from Step 2 in the Revoke Coupon API.

This is not a part of any standard package. Please reach out to your CSM to enable the personalization of the coupon feature.\n\nTo create this follow the steps:\n\nNavigate to the Engage + module and click on Incentives .\n\nClick on* Create Offer* .\n\nEnter the basic details of the coupon series like offer name, offer expiry, discount value for each coupon(fixed/percentage), products applicable etc.\n\nEnter the basic details of the coupon series like offer name, offer expiry, discount value for each coupon(fixed/percentage), products applicable etc.\n\nWhile selecting how to generate coupon codes for the series : Select Through capillary. Click on Generate common codes(s) -> Generate randomized common code(s).\n\nWhile selecting how to generate coupon codes for the series :\n\nSelect Through capillary.\n\nClick on Generate common codes(s) -> Generate randomized common code(s).\n\nEnter the sample common code, it could be numeric or alphanumeric.\n\nEnter the sample common code, it could be numeric or alphanumeric.\n\nHere, in this case, TEST12345 is just a sample code to generate the randomized codes from this reference.\n\nThe system will take the length of the sample code provided and if it is numeric or alphanumeric and then generate the random codes based on this input.\n\nThe resulting codes will be of the same length and will have 50% of the code as fixed for all the codes, i.e. in this case, let’s say TEST will be fixed and the remaining 5 digits will be randomly generated.\n\nThe fixed part will be unique in the backend for an org.\nNote: Min 5 characters should be there in the sample code and Max. of 10 characters is supported.\n\nOnce the offer is created, the sample code provided at the time of creation can’t be changed and in the UI, in edit flow, it won’t be the same code which was provided at the time of offer creation.\n\nThis option is only available when offers are created from the incentives section but can be claimed in any module.\n\nThis type of series can only be created via UI and not via coupon APIs.\n\nThe feature of uploading customers won’t be available for this type of coupon series.\n\nThis option is not available for offers created via campaign flow or loyalty flow.\n\nTime to issue 30M coupons via campaigns flows 3 hours.\n\nWith this feature, we can issue a maximum of 60 million unique coupons when 10-digit alphanumeric characters are used to create a coupon series.\nNote: The system allows for coupons to have multiple currencies and it is important to note that the coupon value will be converted to the store default currency at the time of transaction.\n\nTrack the reversal status of a coupon\n\nThis feature allows brands to easily indicate which coupons have been reversed and reinstated in the mobile app's user interface.\n\nThis will help customers to easily identify the coupon that was reversed, thus reducing confusion and the number of queries made to support.\n\nAdditionally, this feature will also improve the customer's experience by providing them with transparency and visibility into the status of their coupons.\n\nBrands can also use this feature to track and analyse the performance of their coupon campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimise their rewards strategy.\n\nImpacted APIs :\nGet Customer Coupons\nGet Coupon details\n\nIn both the API response, isReversed and last_status_change_on values would be returning from the coupon_redemptions table based on the active and last_status_change_on columns.\n\nCoupon APIs\n\nIf you specify a zone in the API call, it will only return offers tagged to that zone, not to individual stores within it. For example, if a brand has stores A, B, and C in zone 1, using \"zone 1\" will only show offers for that zone, not for stores A, B, or C. To get offers for those specific stores, you need to include their store IDs in the API call.\n\nThe provided orgEntityIds won't be validated, meaning if an invalid ID is entered (not a proper store, zone, or concept ID), no error will be shown; instead, you simply won't receive any results for that ID.\n\nYou can only filter by one orgEntityType at a time in a single request.\n\nManage store and zone-level redemption settings\n\nThis helps brands select & upload store names while creating a coupon series to restrict the coupon redemption to those stores. However, brands generally run scope restrictions based on store name.\n\nTo add store IDs for coupon series via Thrift,\n\nAPI based implementation details,\n\nredemptionOrgEntityDetails is a list of redemptionOrgEntityType and orgEntityId.\n\nAdd redemptionOrgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.\n\nAdd orgEntityId as a store, zone or concept id.\n\nThis is to be added in thrift SaveCouponConfigRequest to make a thrift call for saveCouponConfiguration.\n\nTo filter store IDs for coupon series via Thrift:\n\nAdd orgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.\n\nAdd orgEntityIds with a list of store, zone or concept IDs.\n\nThis is to be added in thrift GetAllCouponConfigsRequest to make a thrift call for getAllCouponConfigurations.\n\nNote:\n\nRefer coupon v1.1 APIs to issue coupon,Resend coupon,Redeem coupon etc..\n\nRefer Coupon v2 APIs to create coupon series, update coupon series etc...\n\nRefer Coupon Upload v1 APIs to upload coupon, upload redeem coupon etc...\n\nSync offers with instore\n\nTo sync offers  that are created or added on Engage+, enable Sync offers to Capillary InStore client toggle button.\n\nUpdated 13 days ago"}

The library encompasses all charts that are activated for the organization, comprising standard charts that come pre-configured and custom charts crafted by your organization's EI users.\n\nTypes of Charts\n\nNormal Chart\n\nA Normal chart is a preconfigured chart having combination of specific KPIs and dimensions. It helps simplifying analysis by presenting relevant metrics in a predefined format.\n\nMigration Chart\n\nA Migration chart is a particular type of chart that helps track the migration of users from one slab or segment to another slab or segment.\n\nFunnel Chart\n\nA Funnel chart helps visualize a linear process that has sequential connected stages. In Insights+, the funnel chart translates a sequence of steps customers go through to complete an objective(purchase).\n\nFor example, for an email campaign funnel, a customer goes through these  stages: link clicked > product page viewed > product clicked > product viewed > added to cart > cart viewed > purchase completed > points issued . The following image shows the different goals of email campaign tracking. Use case of funnel chart:\n\nOverlap Chart\n\nAn Overlap chart is a custom chart that is generated at the backend and cannot be manually created. An Overlap Chart is particularly useful when visualizing shared patterns in data. For instance, consider Customer 1 who purchases items A and B, and another customer who buys items B and C. An Overlap Chart assists in illustrating the commonality between these customers by plotting the overlapping purchase data. This visualization method is valuable for understanding and highlighting shared elements or trends among different sets of data, providing insights into patterns and intersections within diverse datasets.\n\nTo incorporate this chart into your report, initiate contact with your organization's sustenance team.\n\nThe chart is available for viewing in the Report section.\n\nLedger Chart\n\nLedger charts are charts similar to bank statements, that include an opening balance, credits, debits, and a closing balance. In the context of a points ledger (liability report), the opening balance represents active points at the report's start, credits denote issued points, debits cover expirations and redemptions, and the closing balance reflects active points at the report's end date.\n\nAs the ledger chart is a custom chart it is generated at the backend and cannot be created manually.\n\nTo incorporate this chart into your report, contact your organization's sustenance team.\n\nThe chart is available for viewing in the Report section.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

To achieve this, we can create a chart using \"Badges Earned\" as the KPI, alongside several dimensions like customer tier/slab, latest transaction date (latest updated date), total transaction value, and the customer's loyalty type.\n\nFollow the given steps to create the \"Badges Earned\" chart:\n\nOn the Insights+ home page, click Library > Charts from the left navigation panel.\n\nClick Create Chart .\n\nKeep the Chart Type as Normal . Click the KPI dropdown to expand the list of KPIs. Select the Badges Earned KPI from the list or type badges in the search box to locate the KPI. Click Select .\n\nClick the Dimension dropdown to expand the list of dimensions. Select the following dimensions - Slab Name; Total Sales and Loyalty Type (under Customers ); and Date (under Latest Updated Date ). Click Select .\n\nClick Apply . This will populate the chart values and shown in the preview.\n\nName the chart and click Create . The chart with the specified KPIs and dimensions is created and is now available in the chart list. Click on the chart to view or edit it. This chart can be incorporated into a report for deeper analysis and reporting.\n\nChart Analysis\n\nThe chart shows the distribution of badges earned by customers across different loyalty slabs and dates. The majority of badges (43%) were earned by customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab on 2024-08-04. Another significant portion (29%) was earned by customers in the same loyalty slab on 2024-08-05. Higher loyalty slabs, such as Gold and Platinum, accounted for fewer badges earned, with 14% badges earned on 2024-08-13 and 2024-08-28, respectively.\n\nKey Insights\n\nLower Loyalty Slab Engagement: Customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab are more active in earning badges, indicating higher engagement or possibly a larger customer base in this segment. Lower Badge Activity in Higher Tiers: The Gold and Platinum tiers show lower badge earning activity, which could imply fewer customers or less engagement in these segments. This chart helps identify which customer segments are most active and where there might be opportunities to boost engagement, especially in the higher loyalty tiers.\n\nMigration Chart\n\nTo create a migration chart:\n\nFrom the left panel, click Library > Charts .\n\nClick Create Chart .\n\nExpand the Chart Type drop-down box and select Migration chart.\n\nExpand the Segment drop-down box and select slab_name .\n\nChoose the desired visualization type based on the description provided in the following:\n\nMultiple migrations : Customer Migrations across all the partitions of a segment. Use this to track the movement of customers activity in different partitions of a segment.\n\nSingle migration grouped by time period : Let you track the migration from one partition to another partition of a segment in the specified period. You need to set the change of from partition and to partition along with the period.\n\nClick Apply .\n\nIn Enter name for the chart , specify a name for the chart.\n\nClick Create .\n\nFunnel Chart\n\nTo create a funnel chart:\n\nNavigate to Library > Charts > Funnel and click Create Chart .\n\nExpand the Chart Type drop-down box and select Funnel chart.\n\nIn the Funnel Completion Time , enter the duration (in the number of days, weeks, or months) to complete all stages.\n\nFunnel completion time is the total duration that a user takes to complete the sequence of steps/stages to achieve a qualified goal.\n\nClick Add Step .

It could be due to poor experience, a slow site, unexpected costs, or other factors that influence the objective (points allocation) during an email promotion. Solution : Here, the funnel chart helps visualize points allocation conversion steps through different transition levels. You can focus on the events - Added to cart and Check out, where many audiences are not moving towards the goal.\n\nExample : Consider you have selected report duration from 1 March to 30 September and a funnel completion time of 10 days.\n\nTable below gives the case scenarios where report duration is from 1 March to 30 September and a funnel completion time of 10 days .\n\nNote\n\nThe first step should start within the report duration to be a part of the funnel chart analysis.\n\nHence, you can track the sum of the actions of all the customers who enter the funnel by performing Step 1, from 1 March to 30 September , and exit it within 10 days by calculating; The number of converted customers between each step and the customer conversion rate between each step.\n\nTable below gives the detailed data of the funnel chart presentation.\n\nOverlap and Ledger Chart\n\nTo create an Overlap or Ledger chart, kindly contact the sustenance team.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

For more information on creating audience groups, click here .\n\nNote\n\nBefore comparing audience groups in Insights+, ensure they are created in Engage+ first.\n\nApplications of audience group filter in reports\n\nThe audience group filter in reports serves several purposes:\n\nRefine a report to display specific audience-related information.\n\nAnalyze customer behavior to improve sales and enhance brand value.\n\nUtilize various audience group filters powered by Capillary's AI stack (AIRA) to forecast customer activities.\n\nDetermine target audiences based on their preferences for timing, products, and store locations.\n\nGenerate effective offers based on audience activity towards a specific brand or product.\n\nNote\n\nAll audience groups, including uploaded, combined, and filter-based groups, can be used as filters in reporting.\n\nApplying an audience group filter in a report\n\nTo apply an audience group filter in a report, perform these steps.\n\nOn the Insights+ page, navigate to the desired report.\n\nOpen the report and click Add audience group to see the list of audience groups.\n\nIn the Audience Group list, search and select the audience group by name.\n\nNote\n\nIn a report, you can apply up to three audience group filters.\n\nClick on the Audience group name to see a brief description of the audience group.\n\nClick Done to apply changes. The applied audience groups are displayed at the top of the report.\n\nNote\n\nTo create audience filters using the data from extended fields, please contact the Insights Sustenance and Data Science team.\n\nUse cases\n\nThe following are the use cases that help you understand the feature.\n\nScenario 1\n\nConsider a scenario where an organization wants to compare the purchasing patterns (based on products purchased) year-over-year (YoY) of a high-value customer group. This like-for-like (LFL) analysis can be accomplished using audience group filters.\n\nPerform the following:\n\nFrom the Insights+ page, open the sales report of interest.\n\nSelect an audience group filter from the compare audience list that has the Transaction date and time filter applied to it.\n\nNow, you can see the product performance (based on product category) for an audience group (audience_demo) between a specific time duration (e.g. for January 2023 and January 2024).\n\nIf you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+ with the Transaction date and time .\n\nScenario 2\n\nConsider a use case where an organization wants to re-target an audience list with a minimum spend offer. To decide the appropriate minimum spend threshold for the offer, perform the following:\n\nFrom the Insights+ page, open or create a report with an average transaction value-based banding of customers.\n\nSelect the audience list to see the distribution of customers with various bands to decide the minimum spend.\n\nNow, you can see the shopping done by customers during a campaign (New Year Campaign) with value-based banding (<5000, 5000-7000, 7000-9000, and 9000).\n\nIf you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+.\n\nNote\n\nThe audience list keeps refreshing (in case of recurring campaigns), and while generating the reports, the audience version available nearest to the report end date is considered. In case, the report end date is prior to the date of audience creation, the report will use the first available instance of the audience. This can be used to perform pre-campaign analysis of the audience. For example, if a campaign began on June 1st, 2024 and the audience was created on June 2nd, 2024, you can also get reports for the reporting period before June 2nd, 2024 (i.e., May 1st, 2024 to May 31st, 2024). In this case, the report would use the first available instance of the audience i.e., of June 2nd, 2024.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/explore-charts-in-reports-explore-mode", "title": "Explore Charts in Reports (Explore Mode)", "text": "Explore Charts in Reports (Explore Mode)\n\nExplore mode lets you focus on a specific chart and analyse the chart data from different perspectives. For example, you can filter down the chart data, split data using dimensions, change visualization, and more. This article covers all the options available in the Chart Explore mode.\n\nTo open the chart explorer, navigate to the chart that you wish to explore and click the explore icon.\n\nReordering KPIs and Attributes\n\nYou may need to arrange the columns of your report in a specific order for better insight. The columns that have a higher priority must appear first so that readability of the report is enhanced and vital data appears as a heads-up.\n\nAdvanced options in the chart explorer, help you drill down your data with features like pivot table, data representation, display percentage of total, KPI filters, and KPI time period.\n\nTo reorder KPIs or attributes, follow the steps.\n\nClick Show advanced chart options and select the required feature (Pivot table or Display % of total or KPI filters or KPI time period).\n\nClick and hold the required KPI/attribute chip in the stackable list.\n\nDrag the KPI/attribute chip up or down to change the order.\n\nNote that the chart views are temporary, meaning they are reset when you refresh the page or navigate back to other reports. However, you can still access the details of the chart, and if needed, download the view in Excel format. If you want to permanently include the chart view in a custom report, you will need to open the report, edit it accordingly, and then save the changes.\n\nSee the following sections for detailed information on each advanced option.\n\nUsing Pivot table\n\nThis feature lets you visualize the data in a table. A table representation is the default view of a report that helps you to clearly analyse your data. You can also swap between rows and columns in order to draw attention to useful information. Pivot table leads to finding information quickly making it vital to data analysis.\n\nFor example, if your rows are dates and columns are KPIs, you can swap rows and columns to make rows as KPIs and columns as dates.\n\nTo swap rows and columns in the table, on the Pivot table, drag the chip in row to column or vice-versa, and click Apply .\n\nThe process of using the Pivot table is shown below.\n\nMulti-level Sorting (Data Representation)\n\nIn Data Representation, you can do a multi-level sorting on the KPI values and attributes in ascending or descending order. When you sort the values of a KPI, you can be aware of the boundary conditions of your data. You can thus view minimum and maximum values, as well as any intermediate values.\n\nMulti-level sorting implies that you can apply sorting on multiple attributes and KPIs present in your report. However, the first KPI/attribute added is given the preference. The first KPI/attribute is titled Sort by and the subsequent KPIs/attributes are titled Then by .\n\nTo sort chart KPIs/attributes in ascending or descending order, use the following steps.\n\nNavigate to the Data representation icon,\n\nChange the priorities for multiple KPIs/attributes by dragging the chips up or down.\n\nExpand the KPI chip drop-down and choose 0 to 9 to sort the KPI values in the ascending order. Choose 9 to 0 to sort in descending order.\n\nTo add more KPIs and attributes to the sorting order, follow these steps.\n\nClick +/- KPIs/attributes to sort and check the KPIs that you want to include.\n\nClick Add to apply the sorting options.\n\nTo clear all the applied sorting options, click Reset .\n\nTo cancel without saving sorting options, click Cancel .\n\nViewing KPI values in percentage (Display % of Total)\n\nYou can view KPI values in percentage to analyse the performance of a KPI and its contribution to the total value. This helps in to decide if any KPI has an overbearing effect on the total value and take measures.\n\nTo view KPI values in percentage of the total, perform the given steps.\n\nClick Display % of total icon.\n\nDrag and drop the Display % of total chip for your preferred KPI. The chart loads and displays the data for display percentage of total feature.\n\nTo apply a display as percentage of total chip to all KPIs available, enable Display % of total for all KPIs and drag and drop the Display % of total chip on any of the KPI. The chart will reload and show the data of display percentage of the total for all additive KPIs.\n\nFor a KPI with Display % of total chip applied, an indication appears on the KPI chip as shown below.\n\nTo remove Display % of total option on a KPI chip, click X.\n\nDisplay percentage of total option can be applied on additive KPIs only.\n\nAdditive KPIs are the KPIs that can be aggregated through all of the dimensions (cumulative). For example, total sales, total registrations, lapsed customers, etc.\n\nApplying KPI Filters\n\nYou can filter chart data KPIs and analyse the results.\n\nThe KPI filters are helpful when you are dealing with large amounts of data and need to narrow down to very specific data points.\n\nTo filter data by KPIs, perform the given steps.\n\nClick the KPI filters icon.\n\nDrag and drop your preferred attribute value to the KPI. You can also search for a filter by typing its name in the search box and applying it by drag-drop.\n\nTo apply a KPI filter to all KPIs available, enable Apply value filters to all KPIs and drag and drop the preferred attribute value on any of the KPI.\n\nThe chart will reload and show the data of the applied filter for all KPIs.\n\nOnce you apply a filter to a KPI, you can view it on the KPI chip, as demonstrated below.\n\nTo remove a value filter on a KPI chip, click X.\n\nViewing KPI Time Period\n\nYou can use KPI time period to view or analyse KPI values for different time periods.\n\nReport time period (RTP) : It is the time period that is selected for the report. This is the default date-range applied to the chart. You can click on the calendar icon and modify the RTP. For more details on how to use date filters, click here .\n\nYou can also apply other time periods if you want to see the data for different time periods in the same chart. It shows all the supported options in the KPI time period widget.\n\nTo analyze the data for different time periods, perform the given steps.\n\nIn Show advanced chart options , navigate to the KPI time period. You will see the list of time periods that can be applied to any KPI.\n\nTill date period: Lets you select week to date (WTD), month to date (MTD), quarter to date (QTD), year to date (YTD), Inception to date (ITD).\n\nLast time period: Shows the data of a KPI for the last `x' days, weeks, months, or quarters. You need to specify the number of days, weeks, months, or quarters in the Last time period box.\n\nTime period relative to RTP: Define custom time period relative to RTP as explained. Click +Add time period Enter relevant Days/Weeks/Months/Quarters in Duration of. Enter relevant Days/Weeks/Months/Quarters in with a gap of. Choose a time period relative to the Report start date or Report end date . Click Add to add the time period.\n\nClick +Add time period\n\nEnter relevant Days/Weeks/Months/Quarters in Duration of.\n\nEnter relevant Days/Weeks/Months/Quarters in with a gap of.\n\nChoose a time period relative to the Report start date or Report end date .\n\nClick Add to add the time period.\n\nDrag and drop a time period filter on your preferred KPI. The chart loads and displays the data for the new time period in a separate column.\n\nTo apply a time period filter to all KPIs available, enable Select time period for all KPIs and drag and drop the desired time period filter on any of the KPI.\n\nThe chart will reload and show the data of the selected time period filter for each KPI in a separate column.\n\nFor a KPI with a time period applied, an indication appears on the KPI chip as shown.\n\nTo remove the added date filter, click X next to the filter.\n\nYou cannot remove the default report time period (RTP). However, if there is another date-filter applied to the KPI, the RTP can be removed.\n\nTo exit the Explore Mode, click the Explore mode heading on the page.

{"url": "https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/apply-dimensions-to-charts", "title": "Apply Dimensions to Charts", "text": "Apply Dimensions to Charts\n\nA dimension is an attribute by which you can classify and group the data. Dimensions can be applied to a KPI but cannot exist independently. Applying various dimensions to charts aids in understanding business data, such as sales data categorized by date, zone, month, year, etc., enabling deeper insights and analysis.\n\nFor example, if you are interested in analyzing the number of transactions at each store, you can set \"Transactions\" as the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), representing the metric you want to measure. The dimension would be \"Store-wise data,\" indicating that you want to categorize the transaction data based on different stores.\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, if you are examining sales data, you can set \"Sales\" as the KPI, representing the metric you are analyzing. The dimension would be \"Product-wise data,\" indicating that you want to categorize the sales data based on different products.\n\nThere are two types of dimensions:\n\nPrimary Dimensions - These are the dimensions selected by default while creating the report.\n\nSecondary Dimensions - These are the additional supported dimension attributes you can add to a chart.\n\nYou can apply dimensions for chart cards.\n\nAdd Dimensions/ Attributes to a Chart\n\nYou can replace primary dimensions with the same type of attribute values by expanding the drop-down box and selecting the values.\n\nTo change the attribute of an applied dimension : Open the report and scroll down to the chart card for which you want to apply dimensions. Expand the attribute drop-down and select the required attribute.\n\nTo add more dimensions, Click +/- attribute .\n\nFor example, to see a month-wise report of the current year, click Date to expand and select Month .\n\nFollowing is the tabular format (for better understanding) of the zone-wise, month-wise reports.\n\nYou can see all applied dimensions below the chart header.\n\nRemove a dimension attribute : Click X to remove the respective attribute.\n\nNote : Dimensions are applied at the chart-card level and cannot be applied to the entire report.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago"}
